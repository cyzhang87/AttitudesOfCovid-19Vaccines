"Several preventive measures have been applied to limit the COVID-19 pandemic, including successful the development and introduction of vaccines. The aim of this study was to investigate adherence to preventive measures and vaccination intentions among nursing students in three European countries and the factors associated with vaccination intention and advising vaccination. A cross-sectional study using convenience/snow-ball sampling strategy was performed in Slovenia, Poland, and Serbia between 12 February and 5 March 2021. Data from 872 eligible respondents were analyzed (mean age 23.5 ?¨¤ 6.5 years, 89% female). Higher adherence to preventive behavior was declared by those working in healthcare (p &amp;lt;0.001), engaged in COVID-19 departments (p &amp;lt;0.001), had not had the disease yet (p &amp;lt;0.001), and had children (p = 0.01). Those groups also expressed higher vaccination intention and advised vaccination to others. Higher vaccination intention and advising vaccination were mostly associated with belief in benefits of vaccine, trust in institutions, perceived effectiveness of vaccine, influence of social environment, protection of patients and perceived health care professionals?¡¥ duty. Fear of side effects and general refusal of vaccines are the main reasons for vaccination hesitancy. The results of the study indicate how higher education institutions can support the development of appropriate professional attitudes and behaviors among nursing students.","Kregar Velikonja, Nevenka, Dobrowolska, Beata, Stanisavljevi?, Sanja, Erjavec, Karmen, Globevnik Velikonja, Vislava, Verdenik, Ivan",,MDPI,,20210702,https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9070781,covidwho-1288847,,7,Healthcare,en,,2021,"Healthcare; 9(7):781, 2021.",Attitudes of Nursing Students towards Vaccination and Other Preventive Measures for Limitation of COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-Sectional Study in Three European Countries,article,,,9,online,1,0
"PURPOSE: The current study investigated how risk exposures, risk perceptions of COVID-19, and negative attitudes toward general vaccination were related to COVID vaccine acceptance among college students. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Data was collected by online survey using RedCap among college students in South Carolina between September 2020 and October 2020. SAMPLE: 1062 college students in South Carolina. MEASURES: risk exposures to COVID-19, perceived severity of COVID-19, perceived susceptibility of COVID-19, negative attitude toward general vaccination, vaccine acceptance of COVID-19. ANALYSIS: Hierarchical linear regression was used to examine the association of these factors with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance controlling for key demographics. RESULTS: Perceived severity of COVID-19 was positively associated with vaccine acceptance (? = 0.19, p &lt; 0.001). Higher level of risk exposures (? = -0.08, p = 0.007) and negative attitude toward general vaccination (? = -0.38, p &lt; 0.001) were associated with low vaccine acceptance. CONCLUSION: We need tailored education messages for college students to emphasize the severity of COVID-19, address the concerns of side effects of general vaccines by dispelling the misconception, and target the most vulnerable subgroups who reported high level of risk exposures while showed low intention to take the vaccine.","Qiao, Shan; Tam, Cheuk Chi; Li, Xiaoming",,MEDLINE,,20210701,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08901171211028407,covidwho-1286789,2168-6602,,Am J Health Promot,en,US,2021,"Am J Health Promot;: 8901171211028407, 2021 Jun 24.

"This study investigated the attitudes of Slovak medical students to COVID-19 vaccination. A cross-sectional study was conducted between 10 March 2021 and 24 March 2021, as the second wave of coronavirus spread in Slovakia. It was performed in four medical faculties with students in years 1-6. An online anonymous questionnaire was distributed through official university platforms. The survey was completed by 1228 of 5374 medical students. The vaccinated group of students had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The study was conducted on 1228 students, of which 880 (71.7%) were vaccinated and 348 unvaccinated (28.3%). The median age was 22 years (range 18-33 years), and 70.6% were women. The lowest vaccination rate was among first (32.7%) and second-year students (61.6%), students living at home with their family (63.8%) and students living in urban areas (69.8%). Only 22.4% of medical students were concerned about serious side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine, and 38.8% were concerned that the COVID-19 vaccine may not be effective. This study provides key information related to medical student vaccination in Slovakia and education about COVID-19 vaccination.","Sovicova, Miroslava; Zibolenova, Jana; Svihrova, Viera; Hudeckova, Henrieta",,MEDLINE,,20210630,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136815,covidwho-1285383,1660-4601,13,Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),en,CH,2021,Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(13)2021 Jun 25. ,Odds Ratio Estimation of Medical Students&#039; Attitudes towards COVID-19 Vaccination.,article,,,18,online,1,0

"Background: In the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the expansion of the more transmissible 20J/501Y.V3 (Gamma) variant of concern (VOC), mRNA vaccines have been made available in French Guiana, an overseas French territory in South America, from mid-January 2021. This study aimed to estimate the willingness to be vaccinated and the socio-demographic and motivational correlates among Health Care Workers (HCWs) in French Guiana. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from January 22 to March 26, 2021 among a sample of HCWs in French Guiana. They were asked about their willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and vaccine hesitancy, vaccine uptake and vaccines attitudes. Factors associated with willingness to get vaccinated have been analyzed with ordinal logistic regression, using Stata software. Results: A total of 579 HCWs were interviewed, including 220 physicians and 200 nurses most often working in hospital (54%) or in the liberal sector (22%). Overall, 65.6% of respondents reported that they were willing or had already been vaccinated against COVID-19, while 24.3% of respondents reported that they did not want to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and 11.2% were unsure. HCWs were more willing to get vaccine if they were older, were worried about COVID-19 and were confident in the management of epidemic. Conversely, participants were less likely to have been vaccinated or willing to if they were nurses or of another non-medical profession, born in French Guiana, feared adverse effects, or if they did not trust pharmaceutical companies and management of the epidemic by authorities. Conclusion: Negative attitudes towards vaccines are a major public health concern among HCWs in French Guiana when considering the current active epidemic with Gamma VOC. General vaccine hesitancy and concerns about future side effects in particular represent important barriers. Low confidence in government and science are significant in COVID-19 vaccine refusal among non-medical staffs. Public health messaging with information on vaccine safety should be tailored to address these concerns. The specific challenges of HCWs from French Guiana must be taken into account.","Vignier, Nicolas, Brureau, Kepha, Granier, Sybille, Breton, Jacques, Michaud, C¡§|line, Gaillet, M¡§|lanie, Agostini, Camille, Ballet, Mathilde, Nacher, Mathieu, Valdes, Audrey, Abboud, Philippe, Adenis, Antoine, Djossou, F¡§|lix, Epelboin, Lo?c, Douine, Maylis",,ProQuest Central,,20210629,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9060682,covidwho-1282661,,6,Vaccines,en,,2021,"Vaccines; 9(6):682, 2021.",Attitudes towards the COVID-19 Vaccine and Willingness to Get Vaccinated among Healthcare Workers in French Guiana: The Influence of Geographical Origin,article,,,9,online and offline,1,0
"Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a deadly virus that continues to afflict many countries worldwide. The development of a COVID-19 vaccine to combat the disease&#039;s spread and devastating effects is still ongoing, and as the pandemic progresses, new, more effective vaccines are likely to be created. The aim of this study was to assess awareness and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination in Ethiopia. Methods: A population-based cross-sectional e-survey was conducted among 425 participants from March 13, 2021 to April 10, 2021. The survey was conducted using a structured and self-reported questionnaire containing informed consent along with three sections (socio-demographic, awareness, and attitude);a multivariable logistic regression model was performed to determine the variables predicting awareness towards COVID-19 vaccinations. Results: The mean score of awareness was 4.3 (SD=1.1) out of 7, with the overall awareness of 40.8%, and the mean score of attitudes was 4.09 (SD=2.16) out of 9, with an overall &quot;positive attitude&quot; score of 24.2%. College and above educational level (AOR=2.21, 95% CI=1.32, 4.62), had access to mass media (AOR=4.75, 95% CI =2.74, 8.24), and urban residency (AOR=2.83, 95% C.I = 1.57, 5.09) were significantly associated with awareness towards COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusion: In Ethiopia, there is a poor knowledge toward COVID-19 vaccines, according to the current report. The findings indicate that authorities should implement an urgent health education program and disseminate more reliable information. Using the media, policymakers should take measures to ensure adequate awareness of COVID-19 vaccinations with various stakeholders.","Mesesle, M.",,MEDLINE,,20210629,https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S316461,covidwho-1282359,,,Infection &amp; Drug Resistance,en,,2021,"Infection &amp; Drug Resistance; 14:2193-2199, 2021.",Awareness and Attitude Towards COVID-19 Vaccination and Associated Factors in Ethiopia: Cross-Sectional Study,article,,,14,online,1,0
"BACKGROUND: The main purpose in this study carried out from the perspective of infodemic was to investigate the relationships between individuals&#039; perceived causes of COVID-19, their attitudes towards vaccine and their levels of trust in information sources in terms of various descriptive characteristics. METHODS: In this cross-sectional and correlational study conducted with 1216 individuals from different provinces of Turkey, the Perception of Causes of COVID-19 (PCa-COVID-19) Scale was used. In addition, a questionnaire including the participants&#039; descriptive characteristics, their attitudes towards vaccine and their level of trust in information sources about Covid-19 was used. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 35.9 ?¨¤ 12.3 years. Of them, 62.5% were women, 59.0% were married, and 62.1% were university graduates. As for their view of having the Covid-19 vaccine, 54.1% thought to have it, 16.2% did not think, and 29.7% were undecided. Although the correlation was not significant, of the participants, those who considered having vaccination mostly trusted YouTube as their source of information. Of the participants, those whose level of trust in government institutions and health professionals was high displayed significantly more favorable attitudes towards vaccine. The participants obtained the highest mean score from the Conspiracy Theories subscale of the PCa-COVID-19 scale. There was a positive and low-level relationship between attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccine, and the Conspiracy Theories (r: 0.214) and Faith Factors (r: 0.066) sub-dimensions of the PCa-COVID-19 Scale. CONCLUSIONS: The level of vaccine hesitancy in Turkey is at an alarming level, and the virus is defined by moderate conspiracy theories. In this context, in the fight against infodemic, it is critical to implement mechanisms that can reveal misinformation and to plan initiatives that can increase the health literacy levels of societies.","Karabela, Semsi Nur; Coskun, Filiz; Hosg?r, Haydar",,MEDLINE,COVID-19; Vaccines; Adult; Attitude; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; SARS-CoV-2; Trust; Turkey; Young Adult,20210624,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11262-1,covidwho-1277933,1471-2458,1,BMC Public Health,en,GB,2021,"BMC Public Health;21(1): 1195, 2021 06 23.

"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the attitudes of healthcare professionals toward the COVID -19 vaccine, which has been introduced to healthcare professionals at the beginning of 2021 and give information to them on the disease and vaccine. This cross-sectional analytical study has been performed by conducting an online survey to the healthcare professionals who work at the healthcare institutions in the province of Samsun in Turkey between December 2020 and January 2021. In addition to sixteen questions about the demographic characteristics, the &quot;Attitudes towards the COVID -19 vaccine&quot; scale has been used. MANOVA test and Spearman rho correlation coefficient were used in analytical examinations. A total of 1426 healthcare professional have been reached. 64.3% of participants were female, 44.1% were nurse/midwife and 66.6% were public employees. Regarding the questions in the sub-dimension of positive attitude, the rate of response of &quot;I agree/I strongly agree&quot; was between 40.6% and 54.6%. Positive attitude mean values differ according to gender, age, institution, presence of children, smoking status, being a relative who died due to COVID -19, and profession (respectively p &lt;?.001, p &lt;?.001, p &lt;?.001, p &lt;?.001, p =?.002, p =?.019, p &lt;?.001). It has been observed that positive and negative attitudes toward COVID -19 vaccination are almost equally distributed and some demographic factors affect the attitude.

"The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the worst global crisis after World War II. Since the vaccine trials are still ongoing, the national lockdowns have been the most effective way to contain its spread. The pandemic has been extremely stressful and full of anxiety for those with comorbidities as they are the most vulnerable to the COVID-19 infections. Various efforts to assess and enhance the knowledge, attitudes, and practice, especially the high-risk groups, are critical to managing the COVID-19 pandemic successfully. A cross-sectional online survey was carried out using a self-designed questionnaire. A total of 383 participants who were 30 years or older, with at least one comorbidity, were included in the study. The mean age of the participants was 50.63?¨¤11.83 years. The most common comorbidities among the included participants were hypertension, followed by diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorders (48.5%, 44.7% and 23.3%, respectively). Our study also showed the education (p=0.004) and occupation (p=0.04) had a significant association with the attitude and practices towards the COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, our study showed that a high level of knowledge, attitude, and practices are the backbone to combat a global crisis like COVID-19.","Saeed, Shazina; Awasthi, Aanchal Anant; Nandi, Dhruv; Kaur, Karunanidhi; Hasan, Shamimul; Janardhanan, Rajiv",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/epidemiology; Comorbidity; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Adult; Anxiety Disorders/epidemiology; COVID-19/virology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics/prevention &amp;amp; control; SARS-CoV-2/physiology; Surveys and Questionnaires",20210611,https://dx.doi.org/10.25122/jml-2020-0184,covidwho-1262735,1844-3117,2,J Med Life,en,RO,2021,"J Med Life;14(2): 225-237, 2021.

"Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus caused a global pandemic, the amount of misinformation in various media outlets has been on the rise. This has caused confusion among both healthcare workers and the general population about what the proper precautions against COVID-19 are. This study investigated attitudes towards misinformation related to protective measures that can be taken against COVID-19. The study was conducted in Saudi Arabia using an online survey questionnaire during the first three months of lockdown responding to the pandemic. The sample size of the study was N = 1294, of which 275 were healthcare workers and 974 were non-healthcare workers. The findings indicate that the Saudi Arabian population has a &quot;Neutral&quot; attitude towards COVID-19-related misinformation, meaning that, overall, they neither agree nor disagree with the most common COVID-19-related misinformation. Both healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers displayed a &quot;Neutral&quot; attitude towards herbal remedies for COVID-19. The level of agreement regarding the SARS-CoV-2 virus remaining in the throat for two days and the BCG vaccine protecting against COVID-19 was low. The findings of this research imply that knowledge dissemination is severely lacking in Saudi Arabia and that the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia should sincerely consider educating healthcare workers better about verified and true information regarding COVID-19. Conclusion: Future research should include larger sample sizes for each of the healthcare specialties surveyed in this study and analyse their attitudes towards COVID-19 misinformation.","Alotiby, Amna Abdullah; Al-Harbi, Laila Naif",,MEDLINE,,20210609,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18116123,covidwho-1259495,1660-4601,11,Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),en,CH,2021,Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(11)2021 Jun 06. ,Attitudes towards COVID-19-Related Medical Misinformation among Healthcare Workers and Non-Healthcare Workers in Saudi Arabia during the Pandemic: An Online Cross-Sectional Survey.,article,,,18,online,1,0
"This cross-sectional study aimed to measure the awareness, and attitude towards COVID-19 disease as well as new vaccine acceptance, among health field community (healthcare workers, health fields teaching staff and students) at the University of Jeddah, Jeddah Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire was designed in English language and included a set of 44 multiple-choice close-ended questions that covered demographic profile of participants, awareness of symptoms and practice against COVID-19. It also included a set of questions that attempted to investigate the attitudes and perceptions towards the uptake of vaccine. Out of the total 186 who participated in this study, 48.4% were 24 years old or younger and 55.9% were health field students. The results showed that majority of participants were aware of most common symptoms and causes of COVID-19 and had positive attitude toward the protective measures against the disease. Regarding the acceptability of vaccination against COVID-19, around 44% of the total participants showed hesitancy to uptake the vaccine of whom, 68.3% were concerned about the adverse effects of the vaccine. Significant differences were found between gender and current position at university of Jeddah in term of vaccine acceptance with p-values of &amp;lt; 0.001. Despite this high level of awareness, health field community at the university of Jeddah have medium acceptance level of disease vaccine. Thus, health educational programs are important to increase the acceptance level among such societies which will contribute to increase the acceptance level among the whole society.

"Introduction: Understanding suburban, Kansas parental attitudes and adherence of recommended childhood vaccination schedules adopts a new level of importance in the era of the SARS-CoV-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. With hopes for release of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine underway, understanding parental perception of vaccines is important to design successful vaccination interventions. Methods: A web-based, cross-sectional survey was administered to approximately 900 parents in Johnson County, Kansas during the summer of 2020. Pearson chi square and Mann-Whitney U tests were utilized to assess the attitudes of Kansas parents towards a potential addition of the influenza vaccine to the required list for K-12 students and furthermore, their general perception of vaccinations, and the impact of COVID-19 on those beliefs. Results: A total of 179 parents responded. Fifty-one percent (n = 92) were in favor of adding the influenza vaccine to the mandatory list (Pro-Addition). Anti-Addition parents had significantly higher levels of distrust (2.1, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and were significantly more concerned about vaccine adverse effects. When presented with a hypothetical situation in which a &quot;safe and effective&quot; COVID-19 vaccine was available, 24% of Anti-Addition parents indicated they would receive the vaccine or obtain it for their children (21 people, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Kansas suburban parents were split on their attitudes towards the addition of the influenza vaccine to the required list for children and the effects of the pandemic. Follow-up qualitative studies of Anti-Addition parents are critical for successful vaccine distribution and coverage in the communities.","Beatty, S.

"BACKGROUND: Parental attitudes towards the vaccines play a key role in the success of the herd immunity for the COVID-19. Psychological health seems to be a controversial determinant of vaccine hesitancy and remains to be investigated. This study attempted to measure parental psychological distress, attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine, and to explore the potential associations. METHODS: An online survey using convenience sampling method was conducted among parents within the school public health network of Shenzhen. Demographic information and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination were collected. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) was applied to measure psychological distress. RESULTS: Overall, 4,748 parents were included (average age: 40.28, standard deviation: 5.08). More than one fifth of them demonstrated psychological distress, in which only 3.3% were moderate to severe symptom. The proportions of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy for themselves, their spouses, and their children were 25.2%, 26.1%, and 27.3%, respectively. Parents with psychological distress were more likely to suffer vaccine hesitancy for themselves (OR: 1.277, 95%CI: 1.091~1.494), for their spouses (OR:1.276, 95%CI: 1.088~1.496) and children (OR:1.274, 95%CI: 1.092~1.486). These associations tended to be more significant among parents with mild or severe psychological distress. LIMITATION: Non-random sampling limited the generalization of our findings to all parents. CONCLUSION: Parents had a low level of psychological distress but relatively high willingness of COVID-19 vaccination when there was no local epidemic but persistent risk of imported cases. Targeted health education and intervention strategies should be provided to people with vaccine hesitancy, especially for those who are susceptible to psychological distress.","Xu, Yucheng; Zhang, Ruiyin; Zhou, Zhifeng; Fan, Jingjie; Liang, Jing; Cai, Lin; Peng, Lin; Ren, Fangmei; Lin, Wei",,MEDLINE,,20210608,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.06.003,covidwho-1253109,1573-2517,,J Affect Disord,en,NL,2021,"J Affect Disord;292: 552-558, 2021 Jun 06.

"Objectives: Young adults are essential to the effective mitigation of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19) given their tendency toward greater frequency of social interactions. Little is known about vaccine willingness during pandemics in European populations. This study examined young people&#039;s attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines in Fall 2020. Methods: Data came from an ongoing longitudinal study&#039;s online COVID-19-focused supplement among young adults aged 22 in Zurich, Switzerland (N = 499) in September 2020. Logistic regressions examined young adults&#039; likelihood of participating in COVID-19 immunization programs. Results: Approximately half of respondents reported being unlikely to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Compared to males, females were more likely to oppose COVID-19 vaccination (p &amp;lt; 0.05). In multivariate models, Sri Lankan maternal background and higher socioeconomic status were associated with a greater likelihood of getting vaccinated against COVID-19 (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Respondents were more likely to report a willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 when they perceived 1) an effective government response (p &amp;lt; 0.05) and 2) their information sources to be objective (p &amp;lt; 0.05).

"Introduction: Although many vaccines are in development and clinical trials, and at least seven vaccines have been distributed worldwide, the world has faced a huge challenge in line with the willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine in a different country including Ethiopia. However, no study has been conducted on the knowledge, attitudes, acceptance, and determinates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, acceptance, and determinants of acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among the adult population in Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 492 study participants from March 1 to March 15, 2021. A multistage sampling technique was used to recruit study participants. Six skilled and qualified data collectors had participated to gather the data using a pretested structured-administered questionnaire. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. P-value &amp;lt; 0.05 was considered to indicate statistically significant association. Results: This study revealed that the level of good knowledge, positive attitude and intention to accept the COVID-19 vaccine were 74%, 44.7%, and 62.6%, respectively. Moreover, having an age ?Y 46 years with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.36 [95% CI, 1.09¡§C 5.39], attended secondary and above education adjusted odds ratio 2.59 [95% CI, 1.52¡§C 4.39], having a chronic disease adjusted odds ratio of 3.14 [95% CI, 1.21¡§C 8.14], and having good knowledge about COVID-19 vaccine adjusted odds ratio 2.59 [95% CI, 1.67¡§C 4.02] were significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Conclusion: In this study, the level of good knowledge, positive attitude, and intention to accept the COVID-19 vaccine were 74%, 44.7%, and 62.6%, respectively. Thus, health education and communication from government sources are very crucial methods to alleviate the negative attitude of the COVID-19 vaccine.","Abebe, Haimanot, Solomon, Shitu, Ayenew, Mose",,ProQuest Central,,20210608,https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S312116,covidwho-1256164,,,Infection and Drug Resistance,en,,2021,"Infection and Drug Resistance; 14:2015-2025, 2021.","Understanding of COVID-19 Vaccine Knowledge, Attitude, Acceptance, and Determinates of COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance Among Adult Population in Ethiopia",article,,,14,offline,1,0
"Background: There are several COVID-19 vaccines available and many are under different stages of development. However, vaccine hesitancy, including vaccination delays and refusals, represents a major hurdle for achieving herd immunity. The current study aims to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and the associated factors.Method: This is a cross-sectional survey-based study that was conducted between Aug and Nov 2020.Results: There were 417 respondents with nearly 61% females, more than 65% fall between the ages of 18 and 29?years, three-quarters holding a university degree, with more than 63% identified as single, and those who have no children represented more than 67% of the respondents. More than 36% of the respondents considered themselves COVID-19 vaccine hesitant.

"Among health care professionals, dentists are more prone to infection due to their direct contact with blood and saliva. This study highlights the level of compliance with infection control measures among dental students; and linked this to their knowledge and attitudes regarding infection control measures and proper vaccinations. The study is a multi-centre analytical cross-sectional survey. The sample size was 969 clinical years&#039; students from governmental and private dental colleges in Sudan and Saudi Arabia. A pre-coded, pre-tested, and anonymous questionnaire consisted of seven categories of knowledge, attitude, awareness, and practices, including 40 questions, was answered. The study has linked knowledge, attitude, and practice in dental clinics with possible COVID-19 transmission in dental clinics. The results showed that the use of some Personal Protective Equipment was low in Sudan and moderate in Saudi Arabia (statistically significant, p &lt; 0.001).

"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus pandemic in Wuhan, China, since December 2019 has been the major public health concern. With the absence of an effective vaccine or treatment for the disease, current control measures are directed toward preventive measures to lessen disease burden and to curb the spread of the virus. AIM: The aim of the study was to assess knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and practices (KAPP) of adult Egyptians toward COVID-19 and to study their determinants. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional survey of a random sample of 999 Egyptian residence aged 16 years and above, it was conducted between April and June 2020 using self-administrated online questionnaire. It consisted of 15, five, and eight questions pertaining to knowledge, attitude, and practices toward COVID-19, respectively, in addition to demographic data. Data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 23.0 at a level of significant at p ?¨¹ 0.05. RESULTS: Out of the 999 participants, 628 (62.8%) were aged (20-&amp;lt;40y), 666 (66.7%) were females 576 (57.6) from urban residence, 665 (66.7%) were married with university educated or higher 605 (60.5%), and only 105 (10.5%) had chronic diseases. The total knowledge score was significantly higher among highly educated, females, in rural areas, married, and governmental workers, while higher educational status, females, married, smokers, and being without chronic diseases and governmental workers were significantly associated with higher practice scores.

"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 was first detected in Lebanon on February 21, 2020; it reached its peak in January 2021, with a total number of 418,448 confirmed cases and 5380 deaths (until March 15, 2021). Gaining insight into factors regarding willingness or refusal for vaccination might guide our goals in raising the awareness and target efforts to increase acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine and maximize the uptake. Therefore, this study aims to assess the intent to receive the COVID-19 vaccine among Lebanese adults and the factors associated with vaccine refusal. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study during November-December 2020 among Lebanese adults from all Lebanese regions using a survey tool with closed-ended questions that included sociodemographic data and questions about vaccine hesitancy, knowledge, attitude, practice, and fear of COVID-19. We used the snowball technique to collect the data because of the COVID-19 imposed lockdown. RESULTS: Of the 579 participants, 21.4% were willing to receive the vaccine, 40.9% refused, and the remainder were unsure of their response. More vaccine hesitancy (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.06; 95% CI 1.03-1.09) was significantly associated with more odds of disagreeing/ strongly disagreeing on receiving the COVID-19 vaccine compared to being neutral. More vaccine hesitancy (aOR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.91-0.99), female gender compared to males (aOR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.32-0.87), and being married compared to single (aOR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.29-0.98) were significantly associated with lower odds of agreeing/strongly agreeing on receiving the COVID-19 vaccine compared to being neutral. CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings revealed a high percentage of people (40%) who strongly disagreed with receiving the vaccine, mainly females, married participants, and those who have a general vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, no significant association was found with knowledge, attitude, or prevention practice regarding COVID-19. Targeted efforts are necessary to increase acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine among the Lebanese population to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Further studies with a larger sample size are warranted to validate our results and provide better insights into the underlying reasons for refusing vaccination.","Kasrine Al Halabi, Carina; Obeid, Sahar; Sacre, Hala; Akel, Marwan; Hallit, Rabih; Salameh, Pascale; Hallit, Souheil",,MEDLINE,COVID-19 Vaccines; COVID-19; Adult; Attitude; Communicable Disease Control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Lebanon; Male; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination,20210601,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10902-w,covidwho-1244916,1471-2458,1,BMC Public Health,en,GB,2021,"BMC Public Health;21(1): 998, 2021 05 27.

"BACKGROUND: This study determined the knowledge, attitudes, and practice regarding COVID-19 and assessed the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among healthcare workers and the general population. METHODS: A web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted using convenience sampling in Libya from December 1 to 18, 2020 among the general population and healthcare workers. Data on demographic characteristics, COVID-19 vaccination-related concerns, knowledge, attitudes, and practice regarding COVID-19, and knowledge, attitudes, and acceptance regarding the COVID-19 vaccine were collected using a self-administered survey. A binomial logistic regression was performed with 70% efficacy to determine the association between acceptance of the vaccine and study variables. RESULTS: Valid and complete responses were collected from 15,087 participants. Of these, 6227 (41.3%) were male and 8860 (58.7%) were female, with a mean (SD) age of 30.6 ?¨¤ 9.8 years. Moreover, 485 (3.2%) participants were infected with COVID-19 at the time of the study, while 2000 (13.3%) had been previously infected. Overall, 2452 (16.3%) participants agreed, and 3127 (20.7%) strongly agreed, with &quot;having concerns about serious vaccine-related complications.&quot; Mask-wearing adherence was reported by 10,268 (68.1%) of the participants. Most participants (14,050, 93.1%) believed that the vaccine should be provided for free, while 7272 (48.2%) were willing to buy it. Regarding vaccine acceptance and efficacy, 12,006 (79.6%) reported their willingness to take the vaccine with an efficacy of 90% or more, 9143 (60.6%) with an efficacy of 70% or more, and only 6212 (41.2%) with an efficacy of 50%. The binomial logistic regression revealed that vaccine acceptance was not associated with belonging to the medical field versus the general population. Acceptance was statistically associated with younger age groups, especially 31-40 (OR = 1.3 [1.09, 1.55]) and 41-50 years (OR = 1.29, [1.09, 1.54]). However, having a family member or friend infected with COVID-19 was positively associated with the likelihood of vaccine acceptance (OR = 1.09 [1.02, 1.18]), while having a friend or family member who died due to COVID-19 was negatively associated with it (OR = 0.89 [0.84, 0.97]). CONCLUSIONS: Acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine is an essential determinant of vaccine uptake and the likelihood of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Developing strategies to decrease public hesitation and increase trust is vital for implementing vaccination programs.","Elhadi, Muhammed; Alsoufi, Ahmed; Alhadi, Abdulmueti; Hmeida, Amel; Alshareea, Entisar; Dokali, Mawadda; Abodabos, Sanabel; Alsadiq, Omaymah; Abdelkabir, Mohammed; Ashini, Aimen; Shaban, Abdulhamid; Mohammed, Saja; Alghudban, Nehal; Bureziza, Eman; Najah, Qasi; Abdulrahman, Khawla; Mshareb, Nora; Derwish, Khawla; Shnfier, Najwa; Burkan, Rayan; Al-Azomi, Marwa; Hamdan, Ayman; Algathafi, Khadeejah; Abdulwahed, Eman; Alheerish, Khadeejah; Lindi, Naeimah; Anaiba, Mohamed; Elbarouni, Abobaker; Alsharif, Monther; Alhaddad, Kamal; Alwhishi, Enas; Aboughuffah, Muad; Aljadidi, Wesal; Jaafari, Aisha; Khaled, Ala; Zaid, Ahmed; Msherghi, Ahmed",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19 Vaccines; COVID-19; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Humans; Libya; Male; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",20210525,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10987-3,covidwho-1238715,1471-2458,1,BMC Public Health,en,GB,2021,"BMC Public Health;21(1): 955, 2021 05 20.

"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic introduced a set of mitigation measures based on personal behavior and attitudes. In the absence of vaccination or specific treatment, it became essential to comply with these measures to reduce infection transmission. Health literacy is the basis for changing behaviors. AIM: To characterize the impact of literacy on knowledge and attitudes towards preventive strategies against COVID-19. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved an online questionnaire applied to students of the University of Porto, Portugal, containing questions about knowledge and attitudes towards COVID-19 based on European guidelines. Health literacy was assessed through the Newest Vital Sign questionnaire. Logistic regression estimated the relationship between health literacy and both knowledge and attitudes. RESULTS: We included 871 participants (76.3% female), with a median age of 22 years old. We found adequate literacy in 92% of our sample, irrespective of gender and age. In the global analysis, 78.6% of the participants had adequate knowledge, and 90.4% had adequate attitudes. We found that better literacy was significantly associated with attitudes towards COVID-19, but not with better knowledge. In a model adjusted for gender, age, and previous education in the health field, female gender and previous education in the health field were associated with better knowledge and attitudes. CONCLUSION: Better health literacy is associated with better attitudes towards preventive strategies against COVID-19.

"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the parents&#039; willingness and attitudes concerning the COVID-19 vaccine. METHOD: This cross-sectional study was performed using a self-administered online survey, covering parents&#039; and their children&#039;s characteristics, parents&#039; willingness and attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 1035 parents participated. RESULTS: Analysis showed that 36.3% of parents were willing to have their children receive the COVID-19 vaccine and that 59.9% were willing to receive it themselves. In addition, 83.9% were willing to have their children vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine if the mortality rates associated with COVID-19 in children increased following a mutation. After adjusting for significant variables, willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (AOR?=?24.91; 95% CI?=?10.93-56.76), willingness for their children to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial (AOR?=?11a??.87; 95% CI?=?2.41-58.40] and advising others to receive the COVID-19 vaccine [AOR?=?7.82; 95% CI?=?2.50-24.49] were associated with greater parents&#039; willingness for their children to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

"The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the difficulty of the US public health system to respond effectively to vulnerable subpopulations, causing disproportionate rates of morbidity and mortality. New York Haredi-Orthodox Jewish communities represent a group that have been heavily impacted by Covid-19. Little research has examined their experience or perceptions toward Covid-19 and vaccines. We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study to explore the experience of Covid-19 among Haredim. Paper surveys were self-administered between December 2020 and January 2021 in Haredi neighborhood pediatricians&#039; offices in Brooklyn, New York. Of 102 respondents, 43% reported either a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral or antibody test. Participants trusted their physicians, Orthodox medical organizations, and rabbinic leaders for medical information. Knowledge of Covid-19 transmission and risk was good (69% answered &amp;#8805; 4/6 questions correctly). Only 12% of respondents would accept a Covid-19 vaccine, 41% were undecided and 47% were strongly hesitant. Independent predictors of strong vaccine hesitancy included believing natural infection to be better than vaccination for developing immunity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-14.86), agreement that prior infection provides a path toward resuming communal life (aOR 4.10; 95% CI 1.22-13.77), and pandemic-related loss of trust in physicians (aOR 5.01; 95% CI 1.05-23.96). The primary disseminators of health information for self-protective religious communities should be stakeholders who understand these groups&#039; unique health needs.

"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers are encouraged annually to get vaccinated against influenza. This year in view of COVID-19 pandemic, attitudes of HCWs towards vaccination are particularly important. A cross-sectional study was completed to understand how to best encourage and facilitate the vaccination of HCWs based on the previous years&#039; findings. METHODS: An online survey was disseminated to all hospital staff via electronic channels. The clinical audit sphinx software was used for data collection and analysis. RESULTS: The total number of responses was n = 728, almost double the rate from 2018 (N = 393). A total of 78% (N = 551) of participants were vaccinated last year. A total of 94% (N = 677) of participants reported their intention to be vaccinated this year. The main barriers listed were being unable to find time (32%, N = 36), side effects (30%, N = 33) and thinking that it does not work (21%, N = 23). The most popular suggestions for how to increase uptake were more mobile immunisation clinics (72%, N = 517) and more information on the vaccine (50%, N = 360). A total of 82% of participants (N = 590) agreed that healthcare workers should be vaccinated, with 56% (N = 405) agreeing that it should be mandatory. Of the participants who were not vaccinated last year (N = 159), 40% (N = 63) agreed that COVID-19 had changed their opinion on influenza immunisation with a further 11% (N = 18) strongly agreeing. DISCUSSION: In light of the increasing number of survey participants, more staff were interested in flu vaccination this year than ever before. The COVID-19 pandemic has had some influence on staff&#039;s likelihood to be vaccinated. Feasibility of immunisation and education posed the largest barriers to HCW vaccination.","Kearns, Emma C; Callanan, Ian; O&#039;Reilly, Ann; Purcell, Aisling; Tuohy, Niamh; Bulfin, Siobhan; Smyth, Angela; Bairead, Emer; Fitzgerald, Susan; Feeney, Eoin; Waqas, Sarmad",,MEDLINE,,20210518,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11845-021-02636-w,covidwho-1227915,1863-4362,,Ir. j. med. sci,en,IE,2021,Ir J Med Sci;2021 May 13. ,Changing attitudes towards annual influenza vaccination amongst staff in a Tertiary Care Irish University Hospital.,article,,,,online,1,0
"Despite the fact that more than a year has passed since the WHO declared the pandemic, there is still no effectivetreatment of COVID-19. According to current knowledge, the only method to stop the virus from spreading is prophylactic vaccination of the population. However, to achieve herd immunity, 60¡§C72% of the population needs to be vaccinated, which is a significant challenge for current healthcare systems. As it has already been proven, having an effective vaccine is not the same as using it. Public acceptance is essential here. The study aimed to assess the changes in the attitudes of online respondents toward vaccination against COVID-19 over time. In the research, a questionnaire designed by the author of the study was used and it was distributed via the Internet in two stages. The questionnaire included a section assessing a sociodemographic status as well as the questions, designed by the author, evaluating the willingness of the respondents to get vaccinated and their main concerns associated with it. The first stage covered the period before the commencement of the population vaccination programme in Poland, i.e., 14¡§C27 December 2020. Then, the survey was redistributed 2 months after the vaccination programme was started, i.e., 1¡§C19 March 2021. Participation in the study was fully anonymous, voluntary and there was a possibility to opt out at any stage of the research. A total of 2048 respondents were surveyed and 26 persons refused to be involved in the research. A total number of 2022 responses were analysed. Stage I of the research involved 22.9% of the respondents (463 persons). The questions were answered by 1559 persons (72.9%) after the survey was redistributed. Among the participants of stage II of the study, 422 (27.1%) persons have already been vaccinated against COVID-19. A comparison of the responses that were collected from both stages of the study showed a slight increase in the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 over time. It turned out that women, residents of large cities, people with a higher level of education and healthcare workers showed a more favourable attitude toward vaccination. According to the results of the survey, chronic diseases do not have a significant impact on the attitude toward vaccinations (p = 0.155). As the social vaccination promotion campaign continued, a slight increase in the willingness to get vaccinated was observed. According to the survey, women, residents of large cities and those with higher education demonstrated more favourable attitudes toward getting vaccinated against COVID-19. It should be stressed that despite the passage of time and the increasing experience with the new types of vaccines against COVID-19, the percentage of people who are afraid of the complications after the vaccination has not decreased significantly and the concern related to the ineffectiveness of vaccination has dramatically increased. This demonstrates the limited effectiveness of the current information system regarding passing the knowledge on of the safety and efficiency of vaccination and it indicates a necessity to modernise it as soon as possible.","Babicki, Mateusz, Mastalerz-Migas, Agnieszka",,MDPI,,20210517,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9050503,covidwho-1227078,,5,Vaccines,en,,2021,"Vaccines; 9(5):503, 2021.",Attitudes toward Vaccination against COVID-19 in Poland.

"Background: In order to achieve long-term optimum public health response, herd immunity is required, and this may happen if general populations willingly offered the COVID- 19 vaccine. The current study aimed to explore the attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccine, and to outline the common barriers interfering with vaccination among Egyptian population. A cross-sectional study has been carried out among 1282 participants utilizing a self-administered questionnaire. Results: Negative attitude was associated with low trust in the capability of the country instructions to combat COVID-19 (OR=5.97, CI95%: 3.37-10.57), unsatisfactory knowledge (OR=15.73 CI95%: 9.54-25.92), being worried about adverse effects (OR=2.97, CI95%: 1.96-4.52), being not committed to protection measures like PPE, HH and social isolation (OR=2.16, CI95%: 1.42-3.25), not working (OR=3.04, CI95%: 2.11-4.36), low education (OR=10.12, CI95%: 7.11-14.40), don&#039;t know deep experienced trials of vaccines (OR=1.76, CI95%: 1.45-2.13), being female (OR=3.09, CI95%: 2.17-4.39), increase age (OR=1.03, CI95%: 1.01-1.06) and depression symptoms (OR=1.64, CI95%: 1.12-2.41). Conclusion: The main barriers of negative attitude toward vaccine include worrying about vaccine side effects, poor knowledge regarding COVID-19 and mistrusting the country&#039;s ability to combat it.","Kasemy, Z.; Shreif, H.; Tantawy, A.; Barakat, A.; Sharif, A.",,Web of Science,,20210517,,covidwho-1226124,,110,Medical Science,en,,2021,"Medical Science; 25(110):1010-1019, 2021.",Barriers to managing COVID-19 pandemic: Attitude towards vaccination and implications for public health,article,,,25,online and offline,1,0
"Background: Negative attitudes towards vaccines and an uncertainty or unwillingness to receive vaccinations are major barriers to managing the COVID-19 pandemic in the long-term. We estimate predictors of four domains of negative attitudes towards vaccines and identify groups most at risk of uncertainty and unwillingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in a large sample of UK adults. Methods: Data were cross-sectional and from 32,361 adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. Ordinary least squares regression analyses examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors on four types of negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial regression examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors, negative vaccine attitudes, and prior vaccine behaviour on uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Findings: 16% of respondents displayed high levels of mistrust about vaccines across one or more domains. Distrustful attitudes towards vaccination were higher amongst individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds, with lower levels of education, lower annual income, poor knowledge of COVID-19, and poor compliance with government COVID-19 guidelines. Overall, 14% of respondents reported unwillingness to receive a vaccine for COVID-19, whilst 23% were unsure. The largest predictors of both COVID-19 vaccine uncertainty and refusal were low-income groups (&amp;lt; 16,000, a year), having not received a flu vaccine last year, poor adherence to COVID-19 government guidelines, female gender, and living with children. Amongst vaccine attitudes, intermediate to high levels of mistrust of vaccine benefit and concerns about future unforeseen side effects were the most important determinants of both uncertainty and unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19. Interpretation: Negative attitudes towards vaccines are a major public health concern in the UK. General mistrust in vaccines and concerns about future side effects in particular will be barriers to achieving population immunity to COVID-19 through vaccination. Public health messaging should be tailored to address these concerns and specifically to women, ethnic minorities, and people with lower levels of education and incomes.

"Background: Public adherence to preventive measures, including flu vaccination, can lower complications from the disease and ultimately conserve health care resources. This study investigated the factors associated with older adults&#039; attitudes toward receiving the flu and the new COVID-19 vaccines, and the efficacy of an educational handout. Methods: A cross sectional study targeting older adults (?Y 65 years) presenting to the Senior Health clinic at MetroHealth Medical Center, Cleveland, for their appointments, during the flu vaccination campaign from October 2020 to February 2021. Targeted participants (n=400) filled an anonymous questionnaire that included their attitudes toward receiving both vaccines and the reasons for their decisions. Those who declined or were uncertain about getting the flu vaccine were given an educational handout summarizing the CDC recommendations for flu vaccination during COVID-19 pandemic. They were called in 4 weeks to inquire if they had reconsidered receiving it. Results: 72% of patients received or were planning to receive the flu shot. This is concordant with data from previous season. Among the identified factors for not receiving the vaccine, 90% never get their flu shot, 84% lacked knowledge of its necessity, while 68% think that the current preventive measures will protect them against both viruses. Only 6% attributed their hesitancy to co-existing COVID-19 virus. At 4 weeks follow up call, 20% reconsidered taking the flu vaccine. Moreover, only 13% of all participants considered receiving the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available. Whereas, the majority (75%) were uncertain about getting it. Among them, 77% chose to watchfully wait, others had concerns of side effects (11%) or preferred to discuss it with their doctors (12%). Of those against the vaccine, 90% were dubious about its production. Conclusion: The majority of patients queried were knowledgeable about the importance of the flu vaccination. However, data showed concerning hesitancy about receiving the novel COVID-19 vaccine. The COVID-19 pandemic does not seem to influence their decisions to receive both vaccines. Overall, our intervention was 8% effective in changing patients&#039; choices to get the flu vaccine. More comprehensive health education strategies are needed to target this particularly vulnerable population.","Tarabay, R.; Al Aridi, R.; Corrigan, M.",,EMBASE,,20210506,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17115,covidwho-1214912,,SUPPL 1,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,en,,2021,"Journal of the American Geriatrics Society; 69(SUPPL 1):S50, 2021.",Knowledge and attitude of older adults toward getting the seasonal flu and the novel COVID-19 vaccines: A cross-sectional study,article,,,69,offline,1,0
"Vaccine hesitancy is a major threat to the success of COVID-19 vaccination programs. The present cross-sectional online survey of adult Poles (n = 1020) expressing a willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was conducted between February and March 2021 and aimed to assess (i) the general trust in different types of vaccines, (ii) the level of acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines already in use in Poland (BNT162b2 by BioNTech/Pfizer, mRNA-1273 by Moderna and AZD1222 by Oxford/AstraZeneca) as well as eight vaccines approved outside European Union (EU) or in advanced stages of clinical trials, (iii) level of fear of vaccination against COVID-19, and (iv) main sources of information on COVID-19 vaccination. Among all major vaccine technology, the highest level of trust was observed for the mRNA platform, with a considerable number of surveyed (&amp;gt;20%) not aware of the existence of vaccines produced using the traditional approach (inactivated and live attenuated vaccines). The age of participants was the main factor differentiating the level of trust in a particular vaccine type. Both BNT162b and mRNA-1273 received a high level of acceptance, contrary to AZD1222. From eight vaccines unauthorized in the EU at the moment of study, the CVnCoV (mRNA;CureVac) was met with the highest level of trust, followed by Ad26.COV2.S (vector;Janssen/Johnson&amp;Johnson) and NVX-CoV2373 (protein;Novavax). Sputnik V (vector;Gamaleya Research Institute) was decidedly the least trusted vaccine. The median level of fear (measured by the 10-point Likert-type scale) in the studied group was 4.0, mostly related to the risk of serious allergic reactions, other severe adverse events and unknown long-term effects of vaccination. Female, individuals with a lower level of education and those not seeking any information on the COVID-19 vaccines revealed a higher fear of vaccination. Experts&#039; materials were the major source of information on COVID-19 vaccines in the studied group. The study shows the level of trust in COVID-19 vaccines can vary much across the producers while the mRNA vaccines are received with a high level of acceptance. It also emphasizes the need for effective and continuous science communication when fighting the pandemic as it may be an ideal time to increase the general awareness of vaccines.","Rzymski, P.; Zeyland, J.; Poniedzialek, B.; Malecka, I.; Wysocki, J.",,MEDLINE,,20210504,https://10.3390/vaccines9040382,covidwho-1209722,,4,Vaccines (Basel),en,,2021,"Vaccines (Basel); 9(4):14, 2021.",The Perception and Attitudes toward COVID-19 Vaccines: A Cross-Sectional Study in Poland,article,,,9,online,1,0
"Background: Global efforts toward the development and deployment of a vaccine for COVID-19 are rapidly advancing. To achieve herd immunity, widespread administration of vaccines is required, which necessitates significant cooperation from the general public. As such, it is crucial that governments and public health agencies understand public sentiments toward vaccines, which can help guide educational campaigns and other targeted policy interventions. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and apply an artificial intelligence¡§Cbased approach to analyze public sentiments on social media in the United Kingdom and the United States toward COVID-19 vaccines to better understand the public attitude and concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: Over 300,000 social media posts related to COVID-19 vaccines were extracted, including 23,571 Facebook posts from the United Kingdom and 144,864 from the United States, along with 40,268 tweets from the United Kingdom and 98,385 from the United States from March 1 to November 22, 2020. We used natural language processing and deep learning¡§Cbased techniques to predict average sentiments, sentiment trends, and topics of discussion. These factors were analyzed longitudinally and geospatially, and manual reading of randomly selected posts on points of interest helped identify underlying themes and validated insights from the analysis. Results: Overall averaged positive, negative, and neutral sentiments were at 58%, 22%, and 17% in the United Kingdom, compared to 56%, 24%, and 18% in the United States, respectively. Public optimism over vaccine development, effectiveness, and trials as well as concerns over their safety, economic viability, and corporation control were identified. We compared our findings to those of nationwide surveys in both countries and found them to correlate broadly. Conclusions: Artificial intelligence¡§Cenabled social media analysis should be considered for adoption by institutions and governments alongside surveys and other conventional methods of assessing public attitude. Such analyses could enable real-time assessment, at scale, of public confidence and trust in COVID-19 vaccines, help address the concerns of vaccine sceptics, and help develop more effective policies and communication strategies to maximize uptake.","Hussain, Amir, Tahir, Ahsen, Hussain, Zain, Sheikh, Zakariya, Gogate, Mandar, Dashtipour, Kia, Azhar, Ali, Sheikh, Aziz",,ProQuest Central,,20210504,http://10.2196/26627,covidwho-1208472,,4,Journal of Medical Internet Research,en,,2021,"Journal of Medical Internet Research; 23(4), 2021.",Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Analysis of Public Attitudes on Facebook and Twitter Toward COVID-19 Vaccines in the United Kingdom and the United States: Observational Study,article,,,23,data mining,0,1
"Introduction: Corona virus COVID-19 pandemic affected entire world, with the India being highly affected. Vaccine is best possible solution to control the pandemic. Various literature review reveals that vaccine is efficacious and safe for all age groups. Many Corona vaccines are currently in developing stage only 2 are available for use in India. Large majority of the population must accept the vaccination and take the vaccine at earliest. In view of this researcher would like to study the knowledge and attitude of general population regarding COVID-19 vaccine so as the vaccination will become acceptable to all population. Methods: The cross-sectional design was used. The study was conducted through online mode during acute phase of disease in January 2021.Data was collected through validated questionnaire. Total 120 individual were included in the study. Results: The result revealed that 2/3 of respondent were having adequate knowledge and having positive about vaccine. Overall acceptance was found 85% among the general population. Respondents that more trust worthy reported information was given by governmental authorities. In initial phase before vaccine entered into the system, people were in confusion state.

"Introduction: adherence to preventive measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 depends on the people??s knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. Living in rural areas may be associated with poor KAP towards COVID-19. This study compares the KAP regarding COVID-19 of people living in rural and urban areas in Cameroon. Methods: this was a comparative cross-sectional study, using data obtained through an online survey of 1,345 Cameroonians amongst which were 828 urban and 517 rural dwellers. The survey questionnaire consisted of; demographic characteristics, 10 questions on Knowledge, 4 on attitudes and 3 on practices. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 25. Results: overall, about two-thirds of participants had correct knowledge of COVID-19. The mean knowledge score for urban dwellers was about twice that of rural dwellers (15.77 ?¨¤ 5.25 vs 8.86 ?¨¤ 7.24 respectively, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, when compared to people who live in urban areas, rural inhabitants are less optimistic about COVID-19 pandemic in Cameroon (OR = 3.43, P&lt;0.001), less likely to accept a trial vaccine for COVID-19 (OR = 1.14, P&lt;0.05), less likely to avoid going to crowded places (OR = 7.42, P&lt;0.01), less likely to wear face mask outdoor (OR = 11.84, P&lt;0,001), and less likely to practice hand hygiene (OR = 1.13, P&lt;0.05).

"Background: Vaccination is an important preventative measure against the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. To implement vaccination and immunization programs effectively, it is essential to investigate public attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines. This study examined the attitudes of Chinese college students toward COVID-19 vaccines and their associated factors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in college students nationwide from December 27, 2020 to January 18, 2021. Attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines and acceptance of future vaccination programs were assessed. Results: Totally, 2,881 college students participated in this survey; of them, 76.3% (95% CI: 74.8% - 77.9%) were willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine in the future. Multiple logistic analysis revealed that students living in urban (OR=1.409, 95% CI: 1.152 - 1.724, p=0.001) and those studying health-related courses (OR=1.581, 95% CI: 1.291 - 1.935, p&lt;0.001) were more likely to have a positive attitude toward COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, those who were worried about being infected with COVID-19 (very much vs no, OR=1.690, 95% CI: 1.212-2.356, p=0.002), heard previously about COVID-19 vaccines (OR=1.659, 95% CI: 1.268-2.170, p&lt;0.001), believed that vaccines are safe (Yes vs No, OR=3.570, 95% CI: 1.825-6.980), thought that vaccines can protect people from being infected with COVID-19 (Yes vs No, OR=1.957, 95% CI: 1.286-2.979, p=0.002), and had encouraged their family and friends to have a vaccine (Yes vs No, OR=17.745, 95% CI: 12.271-25.660, p&lt;0.001) had higher acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusions: A high rate of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines was found among Chinese college students. However, vaccine uptake may be reduced by concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy. Alleviating these concerns and enhancing public confidence in vaccines are crucial for future immunization programs against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bai, Wei; Cai, Hong; Liu, Shou; Liu, Huanzhong; Qi, Han; Chen, Xu; Liu, Rui; Cheung, Teris; Su, Zhaohui; Ng, Chee H; Xiang, Yu-Tao",,MEDLINE,Attitude to Health; COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; Students/psychology; Universities; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Young Adult,20210430,https://dx.doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.58835,covidwho-1206428,1449-2288,6,Int J Biol Sci,en,AU,2021,"Int J Biol Sci;17(6): 1469-1475, 2021.

"Vaccines are effective interventions that can reduce the high burden of diseases globally. However, public vaccine hesitancy is a pressing problem for public health authorities. With the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, little information is available on the public acceptability and attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccines in Jordan. This study aimed to investigate the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines and its predictors in addition to the attitudes towards these vaccines among public in Jordan. An online, cross-sectional, and self-administered questionnaire was instrumentalized to survey adult participants from Jordan on the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines. Logistic regression analysis was used to find the predictors of COVID-19 vaccines&#039; acceptability. A total of 3,100 participants completed the survey. The public acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines was fairly low (37.4%) in Jordan. Males (OR = 2.488, 95CI% = 1.834-3.375, p &lt; .001) and those who took the seasonal influenza vaccine (OR = 2.036, 95CI% = 1.306-3.174, p = .002) were more likely to accept COVID-19 vaccines. Similarly, participants who believed that vaccines are generally safe (OR = 9.258, 95CI% = 6.020-14.237, p &lt; .001) and those who were willing to pay for vaccines (OR = 19.223, 95CI% = 13.665-27.042, p &lt; .001), once available, were more likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccines. However, those above 35 years old (OR = 0.376, 95CI% = 0.233-0.607, p &lt; .001) and employed participants (OR = 0.542, 95CI% = 0.405-0.725, p &lt; .001) were less likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, participants who believed that there was a conspiracy behind COVID-19 (OR = 0.502, 95CI% = 0.356-0.709, p &lt; .001) and those who do not trust any source of information on COVID-19 vaccines (OR = 0.271, 95CI% = 0.183-0.400, p &lt; .001), were less likely to have acceptance towards them. The most trusted sources of information on COVID-19 vaccines were healthcare providers. Systematic interventions are required by public health authorities to reduce the levels of vaccines&#039; hesitancy and improve their acceptance. We believe these results and specifically the low rate of acceptability is alarming to Jordanian health authorities and should stir further studies on the root causes and the need of awareness campaigns. These interventions should take the form of reviving the trust in national health authorities and structured awareness campaigns that offer transparent information about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines and the technology that was utilized in their production.","El-Elimat, Tamam; AbuAlSamen, Mahmoud M; Almomani, Basima A; Al-Sawalha, Nour A; Alali, Feras Q",,MEDLINE,"Attitude; COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Vaccination/psychology; Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19/virology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Jordan; Male; Odds Ratio; SARS-CoV-2/isolation &amp;amp; purification; Statistics, Nonparametric; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Vaccination Refusal/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Young Adult",20210427,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250555,covidwho-1199978,1932-6203,4,PLoS One,en,US,2021,"PLoS One;16(4): e0250555, 2021.

"Introduction: Around 30% of patients with severe COVID-19 infection are need admission to an ICU for specialized care. Ninety percent of these patients present with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome corona. Inadequate knowledge and incorrect attitudes among the postgraduates working in ICU can directly influence practices and lead to poor infection control practice, poor management, and spread of disease. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, perception, and attitude of postgraduate students posted toward the COVID-19. Materials and methods: After ethical committee approval (CTRI REF/2020/11/038549), a descriptive cross-sectional study was done among postgraduate students of different teaching hospitals in South India. Data were collected through the first week off from September 1 to September 8, 2020, during the peak of the pandemic. A convenience sampling technique was used to select participants. The sample size was calculated using EpiCalc-2000 based on the following assumption: the proportion of good knowledge 50%, level of confidence 95% and precision 5%, and apparent prevalence 0.05, to be 74. Then, the sample size increased by 10% to overcome non-response. Confidentiality precautions were ensured during the data collection process. A self-administered questionnaire was used, it was developed by the authors after reviewing previously conducted research, visiting the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and WHO websites for frequently asked questions. The questionnaire for best practices was selected after studying various review articles, meta-analyzes, and the WHO website. The questionnaire was checked and validated for content and relevance by authors, and one public health and one anesthesia professor. The questionnaire covered the following: (I) Demographic characters: age, sex, years of critical care experience, type of organization in which responders are working, hours of work/day, and whether they were quarantined after the work. (II) The knowledge section: consisted of 20 knowledge questions covering the main general information, mode of transmission, treatment modalities, and ways of disease prevention. Each question was answered by either yes, no, or don&#039;t know. (III) The attitude section;included 10 questions assessing the responder&#039;s attitudes of COVID-19 as a preventable and controllable disease (six items), their attitudes toward regulations taken by the Hospital/Government to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic situation (four items). Response to each item was recorded on the 5-point Likert scale as follows: strongly agree (5-points), agree (4-points), undecided (3-points), disagree (2-points), and strongly disagree. (IV) Risk perception: included assessment of postgraduates&#039; feelings and perception of fear from catching COVID-19. The response could be either yes or no. As the responders were from various hospitals in south India, we used the online data collection method via Google Forms. Results: Best practices 20 questions 95.3% of responders commented that there are separate donning and doffing rooms. 40% of hospitals had 2:1 and another 40% 3:1 of patient to staff ratio. It is 43.4% of responders were unaware of how many times per day the floors and surfaces are cleaned. Only 47% of responders committed that the WHO&#039;S five moments of hand hygiene was strictly followed. 17% of places did not use bacterial filters for mechanically ventilated patients and 53% used HME. 71% of responders were aware of the modified ACLS guidelines for COVID suspect patients. 55% of responders agreed that Remedisivir should be started only in moderate to severe cases. 55% of responders preferred Methylprednisolone to treat COVID sequelae. Knowledge: 10 questions The mean knowledge score of participants was 8.5 ?¨¤ 2.7 ranged from 7 to 10, with the mean correct answer rate of questions was 88.4%. Attitude 10 questions although the majority of our participants considered COVID-19 as a severe disease, they agreed that this disease can be prevented. The vast majority of doctors agreed that infection cont ol standard precaution can protect against COVID-19 (95.6%) after working in COVID ICU. Generally speaking, a positive attitude was more observed among males than females in many attitude items. Perception: 10 questions regarding risk perception, about 83.1% of our participants reported that they were afraid of being infected with COVID-19, and 89.2% stated that they were more susceptible to COVID-19 infection as compared to others. The most common statements accepted by participants as causes of perception of fear of COVID-19 infection were the following: fear of transmission of infection to their families (96.5%), the disease is highly transmissible (91.74%), COVID-I9 new disease with no available vaccine (58.6%) or treatment (77%), the fatality of the disease (62.1%). Discussions: In the current study, the knowledge level of postgraduates about COVID-19 was high. The mean correct answer rate was 8.5 ?¨¤ 2.7. This comes in accordance with studies conducted by Abdul, Zhang, and Ghiao, who had reported about 80 to 90% of their respondents had a sufficient level of knowledge. Although many articles were charting out the best practices, we could not find any systematic survey to check whether the practices were followed. WHO&#039;s 5 moments of hand hygiene, refrain from touching eyes, mouth, and nose, and putting surgical face mask were among the preventive measures frequently accepted by our participants. Ng et al. outlined that surgical masks are similarly as effective as N95 respirators if used with hand wash and other infection prevention precautions. Inconsistent with our findings, Kumar et al. and Olum et al. found HCWs&#039; knowledge regarding the role of face masks in the prevention of the disease to be moderate to poor. It worth mentioning that, and despite their high knowledge score, the vast majority of our respondents were afraid and felt more susceptible to have COVID-19 infection. This parallels studies that found an association between the level of fear and risk perception. Abdel in his Egyptian study reported that two-thirds of HCWs thought they were more susceptible to get infected, which resembles our study. Conclusion: At the time of writing this manuscript, the national statistics indicate that up to 30% of SARS COVID-19 patients needed ICU admission for ARDS. The majority of them needed different levels of oxygen support from simple masks to NIV to ventilator support. Probably, the timely availability of PPE, the strict infection control measures, and the frequent CME&#039;s and awareness sessions are responsible for making India one among the handful of countries with a very low mortality rate of 10%.","Yuvashree, M.; Gayathri, B.; Pushparani, Ksheerabdhi, S.",,EMBASE,,20210427,https://doi.org/10.5005/jp-journals-10071-23711.92,covidwho-1200258,,SUPPL 1,Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine,en,,2021,"Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine; 25(SUPPL 1):S50-S51, 2021.","Assessment of best practices, knowledge, attitude, and perception of postgraduates working in COVID ICU-a multicenter study from South India",article,,,25,online,1,0
"BACKGROUND: Public support of public health measures including physical distancing, masking, staying home while sick, avoiding crowded indoor spaces and contact tracing/exposure notification applications remains critical for reducing spread of COVID-19. The aim of our work was to understand current behaviours and attitudes towards public health measures as well as barriers individuals face in following public health measures. We also sought to identify attitudes persons have regarding a COVID-19 vaccine and reasons why they may not accept a vaccine. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in August 2020, in Alberta, Canada in persons 18 years and older. This survey evaluated current behaviours, barriers and attitudes towards public health measures and a COVID-19 vaccine. Cluster analysis was used to identify key patterns that summarize data variations among observations. RESULTS: Of the 60 total respondents, the majority of persons were always or often physically distancing (73%), masking (65%) and staying home while sick (67%). Bars/pubs/lounges or nightclubs were visited rarely or never by 63% of respondents. Persons identified staying home while sick to provide the highest benefit (83%) in reducing spread of COVID-19. There were a large proportion of persons who had not downloaded or used a contact tracing/exposure notification app (77%) and who would not receive a COVID-19 vaccine when available (20%) or were unsure (12%). Reporting health authorities as most trusted sources of health information was associated with greater percentage of potential uptake of vaccine but not related to contact tracing app download and use. Individuals with lower concern of getting and spreading COVID-19 showed the least uptake of public health measures except for avoiding public places such as bars. Lower concern regarding COVID-19 was also associated with more negative responses to taking a potential COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSION: These results suggest informational frames and themes focusing on individual risks, highlighting concern for COVID-19 and targeting improving trust for health authorities may be most effective in increasing public health measures. With the ultimate goal of preventing spread of COVID-19, understanding persons&#039; attitudes towards both public health measures and a COVID-19 vaccine remains critical to addressing barriers and implementing targeted interventions and messaging to improve uptake.","Lang, Raynell; Benham, Jamie L; Atabati, Omid; Hollis, Aidan; Tombe, Trevor; Shaffer, Blake; Burns, Katharina Kovacs; MacKean, Gail; L¡§|veill¡§|, Tova; McCormack, Brandi; Sheikh, Hasan; Fullerton, Madison M; Tang, Theresa; Boucher, Jean-Christophe; Constantinescu, Cora; Mourali, Mehdi; Manns, Braden J; Marshall, Deborah A; Hu, Jia; Oxoby, Robert J",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Communicable Disease Control; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Adolescent; Adult; Alberta; COVID-19 Vaccines; Communication; Contact Tracing; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination/psychology; Young Adult",20210426,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10790-0,covidwho-1197345,1471-2458,1,BMC Public Health,en,GB,2021,"BMC Public Health;21(1): 765, 2021 04 21.

"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There seems to be hesitation in the general population in accepting COVID 19 vaccine because of associated myths and/or misinformation. This study is dedicated to develop and validate a tool to interpret vaccine acceptance and/or hesitancy by assessing the knowledge, attitude, practices, and concerns regarding the COVID vaccine. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Mixed methods study design was used. In phase 1, the questionnaire was developed through literature review, focus group discussion, expert evaluation, and pre-testing. In phase 2, the validity of the questionnaire was obtained by conducting a cross-sectional survey on 201 participants. The construct validity was established via principal component analysis. Cronbach&#039;s alpha value was used to assess the reliability of the questionnaire. RESULTS: The 39-item questionnaire to assess the knowledge, attitude, practices, and concerns regarding the COVID-19 vaccine was developed. The Cronbach&#039;s alpha value of the questionnaire was 0.86 suggesting a good internal consistency. CONCLUSION: The developed tool is valid to assess the knowledge, attitude, practices and concerns regarding the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and/or hesitancy.

"Background: Malaysia is no exception to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to date, there is no specific treatment to cure the dis-ease, and the vaccine is still not available. Hence, to stress the importance of practising protective measures. Objective: This study intended to examine the knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19 and its preventive measures among Malaysian amid the CMCO (Conditional Movement Control Order) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted online among Malaysians aged 18 years old and above from May to June 2020 using a self-developed questionnaire through snowball sampling. Results: A total of 571 respondents were analyzed. The average age was 26 years old, and monthly income was RM1500, about half were females (57.8%), had education level to undergraduate (58.1%), one-third were Indians (34.7%), one-fifth were Malays (23.6%), one-third from Sarawak (31.2%), and one-fifth from Selangor (25.0 %). The correct rate for all three outcome domains was high, 83% for knowledge, 85% for attitude, and 86% for practice. Few respondents still holding the myths regard-ing COVID-19. No significant factors contributed to the knowledge score. Factors that contributed to higher attitude scores were monthly income and employment status. Factors that contributed to higher practice scores were female, Chinese, and medical employees. The higher the knowledge score, the higher the attitude score and practice score. Conclusions: Malaysians discerned and optimistic about COVID-19, its preventive measures, and the implementation of MCO. They had confidence with the government in combating COVID-19 and were practising preventive measures. ? IJCRR.","Elias, R.; Vigayan, G. A. P.; Mohana Kumar, H. V. A. P.; Sevanesan, M. S. A.

"The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the worst global crisis. Since no successful treatment and vaccine have been reported, efforts to improve the public&#039;s knowledge, attitudes, and practices are critical to reducing the spread of COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the general public knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding COVID-19. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in three developing countries (China, India, and Pakistan). The reason for choosing only three countries is to identify the cross-border effect statistically and data collection constraints. The IBM SPSS version 23.0 was used for descriptive, univariate, and multivariate analysis of the study. One thousand one hundred and sixty participants completed the study, one-quarter of them were female, and three-quarters were male. The study&#039;s findings evidenced that the knowledge and attitude correlation was 58.4% and between knowledge and practices 18.2%. Furthermore, the knowledge was found lower in females, among India and Pakistan, and people aged less and equivalent to 30 years. The attitudes among respondents were found poorer among unmarried females and India and Pakistan residents. While the practices found lower among employed, unemployed and, respondents had a bachelor&#039;s degree, and females reside in India.

"While the problem of vaccine hesitancy is not new, it has become more pronounced with the new COVID-19 vaccines and represents an obstacle to resolving the crisis. Even people who would usually trust vaccines and experts now prefer to wait for more information. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Slovenia in December 2020 to find out the attitudes of the population regarding COVID-19 vaccination and the factors that affect these attitudes. Based on 12,042 fully completed questionnaires, we find that higher intention to get vaccinated is associated with men, older respondents, physicians and medical students, respondents who got the influenza vaccination, those who knew someone who had gotten hospitalised or died from COVID-19 and those who have more trust in experts, institutions and vaccines. Nurses and technicians were less likely to get vaccinated. In answers to an open question, sceptics were split into those doubting the quality due to the rapid development of the vaccine and those that reported personal experiences with side effects of prior vaccinations. Although the Slovenian population is diverse in its attitudes towards vaccination, the results are comparable to those found in other countries. However, there are potential limitations to the generalizability of the findings that should be addressed in future studies.","Petravic, Luka; Arh, Rok; Gabrovec, Tina; Jazbec, Lucija; Rupcic, Nika; Staresinic, Nina; Zorman, Lea; Pretnar, Ajda; Srakar, Andrej; Zwitter, Matjaz; Slavec, Ana",,MEDLINE,,20210407,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9030247,covidwho-1167769,2076-393X,3,,en,CH,2021,Vaccines (Basel);9(3)2021 Mar 12. ,Factors Affecting Attitudes towards COVID-19 Vaccination: An Online Survey in Slovenia.,article,,,9,online,1,0
"Aim: The objective of this study was to explore the public knowledge and attitudes towards COVID-19 Vaccination in Saudi Arabia. Methodology: This was an online, questionnaire-based cross-sectional study included a questionnaire that was prepared using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire was disseminated by social media platforms to be filled by the public in January 2021. Results: Most of the respondents were females (78.00%) and the age of the majority of them was less than 25 years old. Most of the respondents were aware of COVID-19 symptoms (94%), Aware of COVID-19 severity (91%), Aware of COVID-19 risk and negative outcomes (70%) and aware of vaccination necessity (68%). Only 37 % of them agreed that COVID-19 vaccination is effective and only 32% of them agreed that the vaccine is safe. Conclusion: The study showed that there was a good acceptability of the public of COVID-19 vaccination but the respondents are worried about the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Efforts to address these concerns and to improve vaccine usage are required. Additionally, targeted educational interventions are needed to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake of the future.","Ahmed, N.

"Background: During the long wait and the global anxiety for a vaccine against COVID-19, impressively high-safety and effective vaccines were invented by multiple pharmaceutical companies. Aim: We aimed to assess the attitudes of healthcare providers and evaluate their intention to advocate for the vaccine. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in a tertiary private hospital where an electronic survey was distributed among healthcare providers (HCPs). The survey contained two sections: socio-demographic characteristics and Likert-scale perception, with 72% internal consistency. Results: The response rate to the email survey was 37% (n = 236). In addition, 169 (71.6%) of respondents were women, with more than half (134, 56.8%) aged ?¨¹35 years. A total of 110 (46.6%) had over 10 years of experience, and most of them were nurses (146, 62%). Univariate analysis revealed that older participants significantly accepted and advocated for the new vaccine more than the younger ones. In the multivariate analysis, men were significantly more likely than women to accept and advocate for the new vaccine, as were those with chronic illnesses. Participants with allergy were significantly less likely to accept the vaccine than others. odds ratio (OR) and p-values were 2.5, 0.003;2.3, 0.04;and 0.4, 0.01, respectively.

"OBJECTIVE: The adherence to public health recommendations to control COVID-19 spread is influenced by public knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP). We performed this cross-sectional study to assess the levels and determinants of public KAP towards COVID-19 in a large, multinational sample. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study (survey). SETTING: The questionnaire was distributed to potential respondents via online platforms. PARTICIPANTS: 71 890 individuals from 22 countries. METHODS: We formulated a four-section questionnaire in English, followed by validation and translation into seven languages. The questionnaire was distributed (May to June 2020) and each participant received a score for each KAP section. RESULTS: Overall, the participants had fair knowledge (mean score: 19.24?¨¤3.59) and attitudes (3.72?¨¤2.31) and good practices (12.12?¨¤1.83) regarding COVID-19. About 92% reported moderate to high compliance with national lockdown. However, significant gaps were observed: only 68.2% knew that infected individuals may be asymptomatic; 45.4% believed that antibiotics are an effective treatment; and 55.4% stated that a vaccine has been developed (at the time of data collection). 71.9% believed or were uncertain that COVID-19 is a global conspiracy; 36.8% and 51% were afraid of contacting doctors and Chinese people, respectively. Further, 66.4% reported the pandemic had moderate to high negative effects on their mental health. Female gender, higher education and urban residents had significantly (p&amp;#8804;0.001) higher knowledge and practice scores. Further, we observed significant correlations between all KAP scores. CONCLUSIONS: Although the public have fair/good knowledge and practices regarding COVID-19, significant gaps should be addressed. Future awareness efforts should target less advantaged groups and future studies should develop new strategies to tackle COVID-19 negative mental health effects.","Masoud, Ahmed Taher; Zaazouee, Mohamed Sayed; Elsayed, Sarah Makram; Ragab, Khaled Mohamed; Kamal, Esraa M; Alnasser, Yusra T; Assar, Ahmed; Nourelden, Anas Z; Istatiah, Loai J; Abd-Elgawad, Mohamed M; Abdelsattar, Ahmed T; Sofy, Ahmed A; Hegazy, Doaa G; Fem¡§aa, Victor Z; Mendon?a, Adriana R; Sayed, Fatma M; Elmoursi, Ahmed; Alareidi, Alaa; Abd-Eltawab, Ahmed K; Abdelmonem, Mohamed; Mohammed, Omar M; Derballa, EzzEldeen A; El-Fas, Kareem A; Abdel-Daim, Mohamed M; Abushouk, Abdelrahman I",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19; Adult; Communicable Disease Control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires",20210329,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043971,covidwho-1150232,2044-6055,2,BMJ Open,en,GB,2021,"BMJ Open;11(2): e043971, 2021 02 23.

"BACKGROUND: Vaccines for COVID-19 are currently available for the public in Israel. The compliance with vaccination has differed between sectors in Israel and the uptake has been substantially lower in the Arab compared with the Jewish population. AIM: To assess ethnic and socio-demographic factors in Israel associated with attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines prior to their introduction. METHODS: A national cross-sectional survey was carried out In Israel during October 2020 using an internet panel of around 100,000 people, supplemented by snowball sampling. A sample of 957 adults aged 30 and over were recruited of whom 606 were Jews (49% males) and 351 were Arabs (38% males). RESULTS: The sample of Arabs was younger than for the Jewish respondents. Among the men, 27.3% of the Jewish and 23.1% of the Arab respondents wanted to be vaccinated immediately, compared with only 13.6% of Jewish women and 12.0% of Arab women. An affirmative answer to the question as to whether they would refuse the vaccine at any stage was given by 7.7% of Jewish men and 29.9% of Arab men, and 17.2% of Jewish women and 41.0% of Arab women. Higher education was associated with less vaccine hesitancy. In multiple logistic regression analysis, the ethnic and gender differences persisted after controlling for age and education. Other factors associated with vaccine hesitancy were the belief that the government restrictions were too lenient and the frequency of socializing prior to the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed a relatively high percentage reported would be reluctant to get vaccinated, prior to the introduction of the vaccine. This was more marked so for Arabs then Jews, and more so for women within the ethnic groups. While this was not a true random sample, the findings are consistent with the large ethnic differences in compliance with the vaccine, currently encountered and reinforce the policy implications for developing effective communication to increase vaccine adherence. Government policies directed at controlling the pandemic should include sector-specific information campaigns, which are tailored to ensure community engagement, using targeted messages to the suspected vaccine hesitant groups. Government ministries, health service providers and local authorities should join hands with civil society organizations to promote vaccine promotion campaigns.","Green, Manfred S; Abdullah, Rania; Vered, Shiraz; Nitzan, Dorit",,MEDLINE,"Arabs/psychology; COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Jews/psychology; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Attitude to Health; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Israel/epidemiology; Male; Middle Aged; SARS-CoV-2; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors",20210323,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13584-021-00458-w,covidwho-1143260,2045-4015,1,Isr J Health Policy Res,en,GB,2021,"Isr J Health Policy Res;10(1): 26, 2021 03 19.

"Vaccines constitute highly effective tools for controlling and eliminating vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) and are assessed to avert between two to three million deaths per year globally. Healthcare personnel (HCP) constitute a priority group for several vaccinations. However, studies indicate significant rates of vaccine hesitancy among them and, therefore, of acceptance of vaccination recommendations. This cross-sectional study was conducted in a university hospital in Southern Italy to assess the knowledge and attitudes of HCP about VPDs before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, estimate their intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and search for determinants that may influence their choice. A self-administered questionnaire was used. HCP improved their knowledge about VPDs and were more favorable to vaccinations in September-December 2020 compared to January-December 2019.

"INTRODUCTION: In the context of a highly contagious virus with only recently approved vaccines and no cure, the key to slowing the spread of the COVID-19 disease and successfully transitioning through the phases of the pandemic, including vaccine uptake, is public adherence to rapidly evolving behaviour-based public health policies. The overall objective of the iCARE Study is to assess public awareness, attitudes, concerns and behavioural responses to COVID-19 public health policies, and their impacts, on people around the world and to link behavioural survey data with policy, mobility and case data to provide behavioural science, data-driven recommendations to governments on how to optimise current policy strategies to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSES: The iCARE study (www.icarestudy.com) uses a multiple cross-sectional survey design to capture self-reported information on a variety of COVID-19 related variables from individuals around the globe. Survey data are captured using two data capture methods: convenience and representative sampling. These data are then linked to open access data for policies, cases and population movement. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The primary ethical approval was obtained from the coordinating site, the Centre int¡§|gr¡§| universitaire de sant¡§| et de services sociaux du Nord-de-l&#039;?le-de-Montr¡§|al (REB#: 2020-2099/03-25-2020). This study will provide high-quality, accelerated and real-time evidence to help us understand the effectiveness of evolving country-level policies and communication strategies to reduce the spread of the COVID-19. Due to the urgency of the pandemic, results will be disseminated in a variety of ways, including policy briefs, social media posts, press releases and through regular scientific methods.","Bacon, Simon L; Lavoie, Kim L; Boyle, Jacqueline; Stojanovic, Jovana; Joyal-Desmarais, Keven",,MEDLINE,Attitude; COVID-19/psychology; Health Policy; Quality of Life; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Pandemics; Public Health; Surveys and Questionnaires,20210317,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046127,covidwho-1133215,2044-6055,3,BMJ Open,en,GB,2021,"BMJ Open;11(3): e046127, 2021 03 11.

"Healthcare workers are particularly exposed to biological risk during their daily occupational activities. Nowadays, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become one of the most widespread infectious agents. In the current study, we performed a survey on the attitude and behavior of Polish healthcare workers (HCW), which comprise physicians (MD) and administrative healthcare assistants (HA) towards the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. Our study involved 2300 subjects (42.17% female; 10.96% MD; 5.87% HA). The evaluation was conducted using a Google Forms survey based on original questions and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items questionnaire. HCW significantly more often demonstrated their willingness to get vaccinated against the SARS-CoV-2 as compared to the control group (82.95% vs. 54.31%, respectively). The main concern, as regards all groups, was the development of long-term side effects after getting COVID-19 vaccine. The study revealed that depression significantly affects the willingness to get vaccinated. The readiness was significantly strengthened by positive medical history of recommended vaccinations, fear of catching COVID-19, as well as fear of passing on the disease to the relatives. Overall, the percentage of HCW, who want to be vaccinated against COVID-19 remains unsatisfactory. Further works exploring this subject are needed to take a step closer to achieving the herd immunity in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Szmyd, Bartosz; Karuga, Filip Franciszek; Bartoszek, Adrian; Staniecka, Katarzyna; Siwecka, Natalia; Bartoszek, Agnieszka; Blaszczyk, Maciej; Radek, Maciej",,MEDLINE,,20210316,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9030218,covidwho-1129792,2076-393X,3,,en,CH,2021,Vaccines (Basel);9(3)2021 Mar 04. ,Attitude and Behaviors towards SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination among Healthcare Workers: A Cross-Sectional Study from Poland.,article,,,9,online,1,0
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has afflicted tens of millions of people, fostering and unprecedent effort in vaccine development and distribution. Healthcare workers (HCW) play a key role in vaccine promotion and patient guidance, and it is likely that hesitancy among this population will have a major impact on the adoption of a successful immunization policy. To investigate HCW attitudes towards anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) vaccination, we developed an anonymous online cross-sectional survey. 1723 Italian HCW responded. Overall, 1155 (67%) intended to be vaccinated, while 443 (26%) were not sure and 125 (7%) declared refusal. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with hesitancy were using Facebook as the main information source and being a non-physician HCW, while predictors of acceptance included younger age, being in close contact with high-risk groups and having received flu vaccination during the 2019-2020 season. Reasons for hesitancy included lack of trust in vaccine safety (85%) and receiving little (78%) or conflicting (69%) information about vaccines. According to our results, adequate investment in vaccine education for healthcare personnel appears to be urgently needed, prioritizing non-physicians and information quality spread through social media. We hope that our data could help governments and policy-makers to target communication in the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination campaign.","Di Gennaro, Francesco; Murri, Rita; Segala, Francesco Vladimiro; Cerruti, Lorenzo; Abdulle, Amina; Saracino, Annalisa; Bavaro, Davide Fiore; Fantoni, Massimo",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Health Personnel/psychology; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; Vaccination Refusal/psychology; Adult; COVID-19/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Humans; Italy/epidemiology; Male; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination Refusal/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data",20210305,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v13030371,covidwho-1115434,1999-4915,3,Viruses,en,CH,2021,Viruses;13(3)2021 02 26. ,Attitudes towards Anti-SARS-CoV2 Vaccination among Healthcare Workers: Results from a National Survey in Italy.,article,,,13,online,1,0

METHODS: This study was carried out to evaluate the degree of vaccine hesitancy and its socio-demographic and attitudinal determinants across a representative sample. A national cross-sectional study using validated hesitancy measurement tool was carried out from October 15, 2020, to November 15, 2020. A total of 7821 adults completed the survey. Relevant socio-demographic data along with attitudes and beliefs around COVID-19 vaccination were collected from the respondents. RESULTS: 20.2% of the respondents stated they would not take the vaccine and 19.8% reported being unsure about taking the prospective COVID-19 vaccine. Citizens and females were more likely to be vaccine hesitators than immigrants and males, respectively. Concerns around the safety of COVID-19 vaccine and its longer-term side effects were the main concerns cited. Personal research around COVID-19 and vaccine were by far the most preferred methods that would increase confidence in accepting the vaccine across all demographic groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports an overall vaccine hesitancy of 20% toward the COVID-19 vaccine and the influence of social media on attitudes toward vaccination which is in keeping with emerging evidence. This finding comes at a time that is close to the start of mass immunization and reports from a migrant-majority population highlighting important socio-demographic determinants around vaccine hesitancy.","Alabdulla, Majid; Reagu, Shuja Mohd; Al-Khal, Abdullatif; Elzain, Marwa; Jones, Roland M",,MEDLINE,"Attitude; COVID-19 Vaccines/immunology; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; Transients and Migrants; Vaccination/psychology; Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Intention; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Patient Acceptance of Health Care",20210223,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/irv.12847,covidwho-1091047,1750-2659,3,Influenza Other Respir Viruses,en,GB,2021,"Influenza Other Respir Viruses;15(3): 361-370, 2021 05.

"BACKGROUND: Despite increasing evidence to support mask effectiveness in mitigating the spread of COVID-19, there is still raging controversy regarding the use of masks. Evaluation of public perceptions, attitudes and the individuals&#039; experience towards mask-wearing is integral to ensuring reasonable compliance and allows authorities to address concerns held by the population. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of lay-people was conducted within a high volume tertiary level institution in Singapore, from 16 October to 16 November 2020. Surveys administered evaluated five questions: 1) duration of mask wear per day, 2) mask-type used, 3) perceived necessity, 4) discomfort level experienced and 5) causes for discomfort. RESULTS: Out of 402 respondents, 67.2% primarily wore disposable surgical masks. 72% felt mask-wearing was necessary to control COVID-19 transmission. 78.4% reported discomfort while wearing masks, with mean discomfort levels of 4.21 out of 10. Impairment to breathing and communication difficulties were the most common discomforts faced. Younger respondents complained of higher incidence of dermatological issues and sweating (p?&lt;?0.05). Respondents who wore masks for longer duration reported higher incidence of dermatological issues (p?=?0.001) and sweating (p?=?0.032). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Even with an available vaccine, adjunctive public health measures such as mask-wearing will likely continue in order to curb COVID-19 transmission. Experience from past pandemics is likely to propagate self-protective behavior within a community. Our study identified several common mask-wearing discomforts, allowing respective organizations valuable market feedback for research and development. With appropriate public attitudes, effective mask-wearing compliance can be attained in a concerted effort against the coronavirus.","Cheok, Gideon J W; Gatot, Cheryl; Sim, Craigven H S; Ng, Y H; Tay, Kenny X K; Howe, T S; Koh, Joyce S B",,MEDLINE,"Attitude; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Masks; SARS-CoV-2; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Communication; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; N95 Respirators; Young Adult",20210222,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idh.2021.01.002,covidwho-1086961,2468-0869,2,Infect Dis Health,en,NL,2021,"Infect Dis Health;26(2): 145-151, 2021 05.

"BACKGROUND: A pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged and affected most of the world in early 2020. To inform effective public health measures we conducted a knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) survey among a Hausa Muslim society in Nigeria in March 2020. METHODS: The study is an analytic cross-sectional survey with questionnaires administered to the general population including Health Care Workers (HCW) in Kano, Nigeria. Participants were recruited by convenience sampling following informed consent. The percentage of KAP scores were categorized as good and poor. Independent predictors of good knowledge of COVID 19 were ascertained using a binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: The questionnaire was administered among urban 32.8%, peri-urban dwellers 32.4%, and to online participants 34.8%. The peri-urban and urban participants were given paper questionnaires. There were 886 study participants with mean age 28.58yrs [SD:10.25] (Interquartile range [IQR]:22yrs-32yrs), males 55.4% with 57.3% having had or were in tertiary education. Most participants were students 40% and civil servants 20%. The overall mean [standard deviation (SD)] for knowledge, attitude and practice scores expressed in percentage was 65.38%[SD15.90], 71.45% [SD14.10], and 65.04% [SD17.02] respectively. Out of the respondents, 270(30.47%) had good knowledge (GK), 158(17.8%) had good attitude (GA), and 230(25.96%) had good practice (GP) using cut-off scores of 75%, 86.5%, and 75% respectively. Over 48% did not agree COVID-19 originated from animals while 60% perceived the pandemic to be due to God&#039;s punishment. Also, 36% thought it was a man-made virus. When rating fear, most respondents [63.5%] had marked fear i.e. &amp;#8805; 7 out of 10 and 56% admitted to modifying their habits recently in fear of contracting the virus. As regards attitude to religious norms, 77.77% agreed on cancellation of the lesser pilgrimage as a measure to curb the spread of the disease while 23.64% admitted that greater pilgrimage (Hajj) should proceed despite the persistence of the ongoing pandemic. About 50% of the respondents insisted on attending Friday congregational prayers despite social distancing. One in four people still harbored stigma towards a person who has recovered from the virus. 28% felt some races are more at risk of the disease though 66% mentioned always practicing social distancing from persons coughing or sneezing. Almost 70% of respondents said they were willing to accept a vaccine with 39% saying they would be willing to pay for it if not publicly funded. In univariate analysis increasing age and having been ever married were associated with GK while tertiary education was associated with GA [Odds Ratio; 95% Confidence Interval] 2.66(1.79-3.95). Independent positive predictors of GK were those who were or had ever been married, those who had marked fear of COVID-19, and had modified their habits in the last three months. Those who had non-tertiary education and had the questionnaire administered as paper rather than online version had GK but age was not a predictor. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of transmission and preventive measures should be improved in the general population cognizant of cultural norms and Islamic practices. The study highlights the importance of considering belief systems and perception in developing control measures against COVID-19.","Habib, Maryam Abdulrazaq; Dayyab, Farouq Muhammad; Iliyasu, Garba; Habib, Abdulrazaq G",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/ethnology; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice/ethnology; Islam/psychology; Adult; COVID-19/epidemiology; COVID-19/psychology; COVID-19/virology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Personnel/psychology; Humans; Knowledge; Male; Nigeria/epidemiology; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2/isolation &amp;amp; purification; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",20210209,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245176,covidwho-1067408,1932-6203,1,PLoS One,en,US,2021,"PLoS One;16(1): e0245176, 2021.

"Background: A safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 has become a public health priority. However, little is known about the public willingness to accept a future COVID-19 vaccine in China. This study aimed to understand the willingness and determinants for the acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine among Chinese adults.Methods: A cross-sectional survey using an online questionnaire was conducted in an adult population in China. Chi-square tests were used to identify differences for various intentions regarding COVID-19 vaccination. The t test was used to identify differences among vaccine hesitancy scores. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the predicated factors associated with the willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.Results: Of the 3195 eligible participants, 83.8% were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and 76.6% believed the vaccine would be beneficial to their health; however, 74.9% expressed concerns or a neutral attitude regarding its potential adverse effects. Of the participants, 76.5% preferred domestically manufactured vaccines and were more willing to be vaccinated than those who preferred imported vaccines. Multivariable logistic regression indicated that lack of confidence, complacency in regard to health, risk of the vaccine, and attention frequency were the main factors affecting the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.Conclusion: Our study indicated that the respondents in China had a high willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine, but some participants also worried about its adverse effects. Information regarding the efficacy and safety of an upcoming COVID-19 vaccine should be disseminated to ensure its acceptance and coverage.","Chen, Musha; Li, Yanjun; Chen, Jiaoshan; Wen, Ziyu; Feng, Fengling; Zou, Huachun; Fu, Chuanxi; Chen, Ling; Shu, Yuelong; Sun, Caijun",,MEDLINE,COVID-19 Vaccines; COVID-19; Adult; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination,20210203,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1853449,covidwho-1057794,2164-554X,7,Hum Vaccin Immunother,en,US,2021,"Hum Vaccin Immunother;17(7): 2279-2288, 2021 07 03.

"BACKGROUND: As a priority group, healthcare personnel (HCP) will be key to success of COVID-19 vaccination programs. The purpose of this study was to assess HCP willingness to get vaccinated and identify specific concerns that would undermine vaccination efforts. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of HCP, including clinical and non-clinical staff, researchers, and trainees between November 23 rd ,2020 and December 5 th ,2020. The survey evaluated attitudes, beliefs and willingness to get vaccinated. RESULTS: A total of 5287 respondents had a mean age of 42.5 years (SD=13.56), and were 72.8% female (n=3842). Overall 57.5 % of individuals expressed intent to receive COVID-19 vaccine. 80.4% were physicians and scientists representing the largest group. 33.6% of registered nurses, 31.6% of allied health professionals, and 32% of master&#039;s level clinicians were unsure they would take the vaccine (p&lt;.001). Respondents who were older, males, White, or Asian were more likely to get vaccinated compared to other groups. Vaccine safety, potential adverse events, efficacy and speed of vaccine development dominated concerns listed by participants. Fewer (54.0%) providers of direct care vs. non-care providers (62.4%), and 52.0% of those who had provided care for COVID-19 patients (vs. 60.6% of those who had not) indicated they would take the vaccine if offered (p&lt;.001). CONCLUSIONS: We observed that self-reported willingness to receive vaccination against COVID-19 differs by hospital roles, with physicians and research scientists showing the highest acceptance. These findings highlight important heterogeneity in personal attitudes among HCPs around COVID-19 vaccines and highlight a need for tailored communication strategies.","Shaw, Jana; Stewart, Telisa; Anderson, Kathryn B; Hanley, Samantha; Thomas, Stephen J; Salmon, Daniel A; Morley, Christopher",,MEDLINE,,20210127,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab054,covidwho-1045875,1537-6591,,Clin. infect. dis,en,US,2021,Clin Infect Dis;2021 Jan 25. ,Assessment of U.S. health care personnel (HCP) attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination in a large university health care system.,article,,,,online,1,0
"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly instigated a global pandemic. Vaccine development is proceeding at an unprecedented pace. Once available, it will be important to maximize vaccine uptake and coverage. OBJECTIVE: To assess intent to be vaccinated against COVID-19 among a representative sample of adults in the United States and identify predictors of and reasons for vaccine hesitancy. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey, fielded from 16 through 20 April 2020. SETTING: Representative sample of adults residing in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Approximately 1000 adults drawn from the AmeriSpeak probability-based research panel, covering approximately 97% of the U.S. household population. MEASUREMENTS: Intent to be vaccinated against COVID-19 was measured with the question, &quot;When a vaccine for the coronavirus becomes available, will you get vaccinated?&quot; Response options were &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; and &quot;not sure.&quot; Participants who responded &quot;no&quot; or &quot;not sure&quot; were asked to provide a reason. RESULTS: A total of 991 AmeriSpeak panel members responded. Overall, 57.6% of participants (n?= 571) intended to be vaccinated, 31.6% (n?= 313) were not sure, and 10.8% (n?= 107) did not intend to be vaccinated. Factors independently associated with vaccine hesitancy (a response of &quot;no&quot; or &quot;not sure&quot;) included younger age, Black race, lower educational attainment, and not having received the influenza vaccine in the prior year. Reasons for vaccine hesitancy included vaccine-specific concerns, a need for more information, antivaccine attitudes or beliefs, and a lack of trust. LIMITATIONS: Participants&#039; intent to be vaccinated was explored before a vaccine was available and when the pandemic was affecting a narrower swath of the United States. Questions about specific information or factors that might increase vaccination acceptance were not included. The survey response rate was 16.1%. CONCLUSION: This national survey, conducted during the coronavirus pandemic, revealed that approximately 3 in 10 adults were not sure they would accept vaccination and 1 in 10 did not intend to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Targeted and multipronged efforts will be needed to increase acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine when one becomes available.

"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak forced cancer care providers to face different challenges in terms of prevention and treatment management due to specific precautions implemented for oncological patients. We aimed to describe the level of knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) among cancer patients, with the purpose to provide an image of the impact of COVID-19 and evaluate the effectiveness of pandemic response measures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We developed a cross-sectional multicentric study that targeted adults with active cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak, aiming to describe KAP related to COVID-19 among Romanian oncological patients. A questionnaire investigating 64 items on KAP related to the novel coronavirus was designed and applied in seven Romanian hospitals. The group of participants consisted of 1585 oncological patients who completed the questionnaire during the outbreak (April-May 2020). RESULTS: Only 172 patients (10.8%) had very good knowledge about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection symptoms, treatment options and incubation period. Only 44.3% of patients identified diarrhoea as a sign of COVID-19. About one-third of patients (32.6%) declared that they are &#039;very worried&#039; about getting infected with the novel coronavirus. More than two-thirds of participants (68%) considered that having cancer represents an additional risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2, but 27.8% would rather not vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2 should a vaccine be available. A small percentage (8.8%) believed that the risk of infection justifies delaying/stopping oncological treatment until after the pandemic. Around half of the participants (55.5%) declared being compliant with all the protective measures against coronavirus infection listed in the questionnaire. CONCLUSION: Romanian oncological patients have a less than expected knowledge about SARS-CoV-2, appropriate prevention behaviours, with limited trust in their efficacy, optimistic attitudes towards COVID-19 and low level of trust in information sources. Good COVID-19 knowledge was associated with appropriate practices towards COVID-19 and optimistic attitudes.","Gheorghe, A S; Negru, S M; Ni¡§¡§?ipir, C; Mazilu, L; Marinca, M; Gafton, B; Ciuleanu, T E; Schenker, M; Dragomir, R D; Gheorghe, A D; Stovicek, P O; Bandi-Vasilica, M; Bo¡§¡§?, A C; Mihaila, R I; Zob, D L; Kajanto, A L; Stanculeanu, D L",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Medical Oncology/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Neoplasms/therapy; Surveys and Questionnaires; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; COVID-19/epidemiology; COVID-19/virology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Male; Medical Oncology/methods; Middle Aged; Neoplasms/diagnosis; Pandemics; Romania/epidemiology; SARS-CoV-2/isolation &amp;amp; purification; SARS-CoV-2/physiology; Young Adult",20210107,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2020.100027,covidwho-1007936,2059-7029,1,ESMO Open,en,GB,2021,"ESMO Open;6(1): 100027, 2021 02.

"The last 2019/20 northern hemisphere influenza season overlapped with the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Italy was the first western country where severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread to a significant extent. In this representative cross-sectional survey, we aimed to describe some opinions and attitudes of the Italian general population towards both influenza vaccination and the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify potential modifiers of the decision-making process regarding the uptake of the 2020/21 influenza vaccine. A total of 2543 responses were analyzed. Although most (74.8%) participants valued influenza vaccination positively and declared that it should be mandatory, some misconceptions around influenza persist. The general practitioner was the main source of trusted information on influenza vaccines, while social networks were judged to be the least reliable. Younger and less affluent individuals, subjects not vaccinated in the previous season, and those living in smaller communities showed lower odds of receiving the 2020/21 season influenza vaccination. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may have positively influenced the propensity of being vaccinated against 2020/21 seasonal influenza. In order to increase influenza vaccination coverage rates multidisciplinary targeted interventions are needed.

"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an unprecedented disruption in medical education and healthcare systems worldwide. The disease can cause life-threatening conditions and it presents challenges for medical education, as instructors must deliver lectures safely, while ensuring the integrity and continuity of the medical education process. It is therefore important to assess the usability of online learning methods, and to determine their feasibility and adequacy for medical students. We aimed to provide an overview of the situation experienced by medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of medical students regarding electronic medical education. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with medical students from more than 13 medical schools in Libya. A paper-based and online survey was conducted using email and social media. The survey requested demographic and socioeconomic information, as well as information related to medical online learning and electronic devices; medical education status during the COVID-19 pandemic; mental health assessments; and e-learning knowledge, attitudes, and practices. A total of 3,348 valid questionnaires were retrieved. Most respondents (64.7%) disagreed that e-learning could be implemented easily in Libya. While 54.1% of the respondents agreed that interactive discussion is achievable by means of e-learning. However, only 21.1% agreed that e-learning could be used for clinical aspects, as compared with 54.8% who disagreed with this statement and 24% who were neutral. Only 27.7% of the respondents had participated in online medical educational programs during the COVID-19 pandemic, while 65% reported using the internet for participating in study groups and discussions. There is no vaccine for COVID-19 yet. As such, the pandemic will undeniably continue to disrupt medical education and training. As we face the prospect of a second wave of virus transmission, we must take certain measures and make changes to minimize the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on medical education and on the progression of training. The time for change is now, and there should be support and enthusiasm for providing valid solutions to reduce this disruption, such as online training and virtual clinical experience. These measures could then be followed by hands-on experience that is provided in a safe environment.","Alsoufi, Ahmed; Alsuyihili, Ali; Msherghi, Ahmed; Elhadi, Ahmed; Atiyah, Hana; Ashini, Aimen; Ashwieb, Arwa; Ghula, Mohamed; Ben Hasan, Hayat; Abudabuos, Salsabil; Alameen, Hind; Abokhdhir, Taqwa; Anaiba, Mohamed; Nagib, Taha; Shuwayyah, Anshirah; Benothman, Rema; Arrefae, Ghalea; Alkhwayildi, Abdulwajid; Alhadi, Abdulmueti; Zaid, Ahmed; Elhadi, Muhammed",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/epidemiology; Education, Distance/methods; Education, Medical, Undergraduate/methods; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Students, Medical/psychology; Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; COVID-19/virology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Learning; Libya/epidemiology; Male; Quarantine/methods; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",20201130,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242905,covidwho-945354,1932-6203,11,PLoS One,en,US,2020,"PLoS One;15(11): e0242905, 2020.

"The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out during the peak season of influenza in China. We aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of influenza among Chinese adults during this special season. A cross-sectional online questionnaire survey was performed by recruiting 4822 participants. There were 76.09% of the participants reporting that they learned more knowledge of influenza during the COVID-19 epidemic. The mean knowledge score of participants was 5.51??¨¤?1.55 (78.7% correct rate), and participants who received influenza vaccination in the past year scored the highest (6.06??¨¤?1.30, p&lt;?.001). Nearly half of the participants (49.63%) agreed the threat to the functioning of society by influenza was far less than the COVID-19. 73.04% of the participants knew influenza vaccination was the most effective way to prevent influenza infection, while 54.18% did not know the vaccination location. The proportion of participants who were willing to get vaccinated would increase from 62.53% to 85.82% if clinicians recommended the vaccination. For influenza-like illness, merely 36.11% of participants would seek medical care from the hospital, and 60.53% agreed or showed a neutral attitude toward antibiotic use for influenza treatment. Regression analyses showed that the medical profession and history of influenza vaccination were both associated with higher knowledge or attitude score and participants&#039; use of face masks in previous seasons and their willingness to receive influenza vaccination. In conclusion, the awareness of influenza vaccination among adults in China should be reinforced and educational campaigns were warranted to increase the coverage of influenza vaccination.","Jiang, Minghuan; Feng, Liuxin; Wang, Weihua; Gong, Yilin; Ming, Wai-Kit; Hayat, Khezar; Li, Pengchao; Gillani, Ali Hassan; Yao, Xuelin; Fang, Yu",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/epidemiology; Health Education; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human/prevention &amp;amp; control; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination/psychology; Adolescent; Adult; China/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Influenza, Human/epidemiology; Male; SARS-CoV-2; Young Adult",20201125,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1812312,covidwho-939536,2164-554X,5,Hum Vaccin Immunother,en,US,2021,"Hum Vaccin Immunother;17(5): 1412-1419, 2021 05 04.

"BACKGROUND: Health care workers are at greater risk of infection during COVID 19 pandemic.? This study was carried out to assess the knowledge and attitude toward COVID-19 among healthcare workers at working at Seti Zonal Hospital. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed between April and May 2020 at Seti Zonal Hospital with purposive sampling technique and self-administered questionnaire of the knowledge and attitude of healthcare workers regarding COVID-19. The demographic characteristics mean knowledge and attitude score of healthcare workers were identified and inferential statistics t-test, ANOVA and Spearman&#039;s correlation were used to show the relationship between variables. RESULTS: A total of 230 healthcare workers (92% response rate) had a mean score of knowledge and attitude of 8?¨¤0.88 and 7.88?¨¤1.32, respectively with good knowledge and a low positive attitude. Majority (94.7%) were familiar with the sign and symptoms, agreed that chronic diseases patients and HCWs are at a higher risk (97%) and (87.8%) respectively while knowledge related to COVID 19 vaccination, isolation period and treatment by antibiotics was poor with low positive attitude towards information availability about COVID 19 (41%), government ability to control the epidemic (49%), and the family members might get infection (60%).

At present, there is no successful cure or vaccine for both COVID-19 and HIV. People with underlying conditions, including HIV, are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 manifestations. This underscores the need to enhance the knowledge, attitudes, and practice of people living with HIV (PLWH) to protect this population against COVID-19. An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from August 31 to September 18, 2020 among 376 participants who were selected by a simple random sampling technique. A?pretested and structured self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Quality scores were calculated as a measure of the participants&#039; knowledge, attitudes, and practice?(KAP) levels. The student t-test was used to compare continuous variables between low (&lt;65%) and high (&amp;#8805;65%) KAP scores. The chi-square test was used to determine the association between KAP scores and categorical variables. All decisions on statistical tests were concluded at 5% level of significance. All statistical analysis was performed using STATA statistical package version 11.2 (STATA Corp., Texas, USA). Of the 376 participants, 363 (97%) obtained a high knowledge score, while more than a quarter of the participants (26%) had a poor attitude score, and the majority (90%) having a high practice score. There was no association between gender, age, place of residence, employment, or duration on ART and knowledge score. Employment status and duration on antiretroviral treatment (ART) were significantly associated with attitude scores (p = 0.004 and p = 0.013, respectively). Gender and duration on ART were significantly associated with practice scores (p = 0.02 and p = 0.012, respectively). There was a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.57) between knowledge and attitude scores, and knowledge and practice scores (r = 0.55). There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.67) between attitude scores and practice scores. Health education programs tailored for PLWH and aimed at mobilizing and improving COVID-19-related knowledge, attitude, and practice should be prioritized in the Rwandan COVID-19 response.","Iradukunda, Patrick Gad; Pierre, Gashema; Muhozi, Valens; Denhere, Knowledge; Dzinamarira, Tafadzwa",,MEDLINE,"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/psychology; COVID-19/psychology; Employment/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Health Education/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/epidemiology; Adult; COVID-19/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Epidemics; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Rwanda; Surveys and Questionnaires",20201030,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10900-020-00938-1,covidwho-891910,1573-3610,2,J Community Health,en,NL,2021,"J Community Health;46(2): 245-250, 2021 04.

"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is an emerging pandemic with heightened concerns for people with compromised immune systems, including people living with HIV. PURPOSE: In the absence of a vaccine, public health messaging to mitigate risks for COVID-19 primarily focuses on social distancing. Because people living with HIV commonly experience mistreatment associated with HIV, their response to social distancing may be complicated by psychosocial attitudes associated with COVID-19. METHODS: To evaluate these relationships, we conducted a rapid-response, cross-sectional survey with people living with HIV (N = 149) to assess social distancing practices, COVID-19 discriminatory attitudes, COVID-19 xenophobic attitudes, HIV microaggressions, and concern over contracting COVID-19. Data were collected from participants enrolled in a larger ongoing study between March 30, 2020 and April 17, 2020. RESULTS: Results indicated that choosing to socially distance to reduce COVID-19 exposure was associated with COVID-19 discriminatory attitudes, concerns of contracting COVID-19, and identifying as transgender. Likewise, social distancing imposed by others (e.g., cancelations and restrictions) was associated with concerns of contracting COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrate that social distancing measures are related to concerns of contracting the virus and discriminatory attitudes toward those who are presumed to be living with COVID-19. These potentially negative psychosocial attitudes toward people perceived to have COVID-19 echo the discriminatory actions and attitudes that we continue to observe in HIV social sciences research.","Berman, Marcie; Eaton, Lisa A; Watson, Ryan J; Andrepont, J L; Kalichman, Seth",,MEDLINE,"Coronavirus Infections/prevention &amp;amp; control; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; HIV Infections/psychology; Pandemics/prevention &amp;amp; control; Pneumonia, Viral/prevention &amp;amp; control; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Social Discrimination/psychology; Social Isolation; Adult; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Prejudice; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",20200918,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/abm/kaaa074,covidwho-772732,1532-4796,10,Ann Behav Med,en,GB,2020,"Ann Behav Med;54(10): 728-737, 2020 10 01.

"Purpose: The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the worst global crisis after the Second World War. Since no successful treatment and vaccine have been reported, efforts to enhance the knowledge, attitudes, and practice of the public, especially the high-risk groups, are critical to manage COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this study aimed to assess knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19 among patients with chronic disease. Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 404 chronic disease patients from March 02 to April 10, 2020, at Addis Zemen Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses with a 95% confidence interval were fitted to identify factors associated with poor knowledge and practice towards COVID-19. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was used to determine the magnitude of the association between the outcome and independent variables. P-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The mean age of the participants was 56.5?¨¤13.5. The prevalence of poor knowledge and poor practice was 33.9% and 47.3%, respectively. Forty-one percent of the participants perceived that avoiding of attending a crowded population is very difficult. Age (AOR=1.05, (95% CI (1.01-1.08)), educational status of &quot;can&#039;t read and write&quot; (AOR=7.1, 95% CI (1.58-31.93)), rural residence (AOR=19.0, 95% CI (6.87-52.66)) and monthly income (AOR=0.8, 95% CI (0.79-0.89)) were significantly associated with poor knowledge. Being unmarried (AOR=3.9, 95% CI (1.47-10.58)), cannot read and write (AOR=2.7, 95% CI (1.03-7.29)), can read and write (AOR=3.5, 95% CI (1.48-8.38)), rural residence (AOR=2.7, 95% CI (1.09-6.70)), income of &lt;7252 Ethiopian birr (AOR=2.3, 95% CI (1.20-4.15)) and poor knowledge (AOR=8.6, 95% CI (3.81-19.45)) were significantly associated with poor practice. Conclusion: The prevalence of poor knowledge and poor practice was high. Leaflets prepared in local languages should be administered and health professionals should provide detailed information about COVID-19 to their patients.","Akalu, Yonas; Ayelign, Birhanu; Molla, Meseret Derbew",,MEDLINE,,20200706,https://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S258736,covidwho-625696,1178-6973,,Infect Drug Resist,en,NZ,2020,"Infect Drug Resist;13: 1949-1960, 2020.

"Introduction: The COVID-19 is currently the most horrible issue around the world as there is no proven vaccine or medicine for this rapidly spreading disease. The only way left to this situation is to slow down or eradicate the spreading by adopting preventing measures. Objective: The purpose of the study is to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices toward COVID-19 among Bangladeshi internet users. Material and Methods: A total of 441 respondents voluntarily participated in a web-based cross-sectional survey. A structured questionnaire was created using Google Forms and the link was shared through authors?¡¥ networks. Collected information was analyzed using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate techniques. Results: Respondent of age 30 and above are more optimistic (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] =1.96, 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.13 to 3.41; P=0.016) compared to respondent of age 18-29. For 1 unit change in the knowledge score the likelihood of staying home and wearing mask increases by 1.73 (95% CI, 1.43 to 2.09; P&amp;lt;0.01) and 1.54 (95% CI, 1.25 to 1.77; P&amp;lt;0.01) times respectively. From the linear regression analysis, we see that urban residence type (vs. rural, |?=0.274; P=0.024) are significantly associated with higher knowledge scores. Additionally, a significant positive correlation exists between the COVID-19 knowledge score and the preventive practice score (r=0.291, P &amp;lt;0.01). Conclusion: Although knowledge and preventive practices among Bangladeshi internet users are encouraging, this study suggests updated knowledge be provided by healthcare authorities to enhance appropriate preventive practices throughout the COVID-19 outbreak.","Rahman, Abdur; Sathi, Nusrat Jahan",,ELSEVIER,,20200604,https://doi.org/10.29333/ejgm/8223,covidwho-506184,25163507,17,Electro.

"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been recognized as a pandemic by the?World Health Organization. Global efforts have been exerted to prevent the spreading of the disease through political decisions together with personal behaviors, which depend on awareness of the public. The goal of this study is to assess the knowledge, perceptions and attitude of the Egyptian public towards the COVID-19 disease. We conducted a cross-sectional survey about these points, which was distributed among adult Egyptians. Five hundred and fifty nine persons completed the survey. The mean knowledge score was 16.39 out of 23, gained mainly though social media (66.9%), and the internet (58.3%). Knowledge was significantly lower among older, less educated, lower income participants, and rural residents. Most participants (86.9%) were concerned about the risk of infection. While 37.6% thought that their salary will be continued if they become isolated, 68.5% believed that it should be continued during this period. About 73.0% were looking forward to get the vaccine when available. In general, participants had a good knowledge about the disease and a positive attitude towards protective measures. This knowledge is gained mainly through novel media channels, which have pros and cons. Although the government has taken major steps to educate the public and limit the spread of the disease, more effort is needed to educate and support the lower economic strata. If a vaccine or a treatment is approved, we recommend a government control over its use to preserve the rights of the vulnerable and needy groups.","Abdelhafiz, Ahmed Samir; Mohammed, Zeinab; Ibrahim, Maha Emad; Ziady, Hany H; Alorabi, Mohamed; Ayyad, Mohamed; Sultan, Eman A",,MEDLINE,"Coronavirus Infections/prevention &amp;amp; control; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Pandemics/prevention &amp;amp; control; Pneumonia, Viral/prevention &amp;amp; control; Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Egypt/epidemiology; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Social Media; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",20200422,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10900-020-00827-7,covidwho-97441,1573-3610,5,J Community Health,en,NL,2020,"J Community Health;45(5): 881-890, 2020 10.

"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The government of India recently planned to start the process of the mass vaccination program to end the COVID-19 crises. However, the process of vaccination was not made mandatory, and there are a lot of aspects that arise skepticism in the minds of common people regarding COVID-19 vaccines. This study using machine learning techniques analyzes the major concerns Indian citizens voice out about COVID-19 vaccines in social media. METHODS: For this study, we have used social media posts as data. Using Python, we have scrapped the social media posts of Indian citizens discussing about the COVID- 19 vaccine. In Study 1, we performed a sentimental analysis to determine how the general perception of Indian citizens regarding the COVID-19 vaccine changes over different months of COVID-19 crises. In Study 2, we have performed topic modeling to understand the major issues that concern the general public regarding the COVID- 19 vaccine. RESULTS: Our results have indicated that 47% of social media posts discussing vaccines were in a neutral tone, and nearly 17% of the social media posts discussing the COVID-19 vaccine were in a negative tone. Fear of health and allergic reactions towards the vaccine are the two prominent issues that concern Indian citizens regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSION: With the positive sentiments regarding vaccine is just over 35%, the Indian government needs to focus especially on addressing the fear of vaccines before implementing the process of mass vaccination.","Praveen, S V; Ittamalla, Rajesh; Deepak, Gerard",,MEDLINE,,20210302,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2021.02.031,1103831,1878-0334,2,Diabetes Metab Syndr,en,NL,2021,"Diabetes Metab Syndr;15(2): 595-599, 2021 Feb 27.
