"BACKGROUND: During COVID-19, the public actively sought non-pharmacological and self-management approaches to prevent infection. Little is known on the use of traditional, complementary and integrative medicine (TCIM) by the public as preventive measures. This study investigated the prevalence and patterns of TCIM use during the pandemic, and identified factors associated with its use among the general population in Hong Kong. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from November to December 2020. The survey solicited information on the respondents&#039; sociodemographic characteristics, risk perception of the pandemic, and use of TCIM before and during the pandemic. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine predictors of TCIM use. RESULTS: In total, 632 responses (completion rate = 88.1%) were analyzed. TCIM was used by 44.0% of respondents during the pandemic. The most popular forms of TCIM were vitamins or other dietary supplements (n = 160, 25.3%) and Chinese herbal medicine (n = 122, 19.3%) during the pandemic. The most frequently reported indication was strengthening the immune system, especially for vitamins or other dietary supplements (n = 142/160, 88.8%). Respondents who reported using TCIM were more likely to be female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29-2.59), had higher education attainment (aOR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.39-3.59), and older-aged (age &gt;55 years: aOR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.04-3.02). Respondents who resided in districts with moderate to high number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (aOR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.07-2.42) and had a higher level of risk perception (aOR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.01-1.07) were also more likely to use TCIM. CONCLUSION: TCIM was used commonly in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic. While vaccination and social distancing remain the mainstay of controlling the pandemic, professional bodies should proactively consider public preferences and provide information regarding the effectiveness and safety of TCIM for COVID-19 prevention and treatment.","Lam, Chun Sing; Koon, Ho Kee; Chung, Vincent Chi-Ho; Cheung, Yin Ting",,MEDLINE,,20210706.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253890,covidwho-1290906,1932-6203,7,PLoS One,en,US,2021.0,"PLoS One;16(7): e0253890, 2021.

"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 epidemic and the related containment strategies may affect parental and pediatric health behaviors. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the change in children&#039;s and adolescents&#039; prevention and vaccination behaviors amid China&#039;s COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in mid-March 2020 using proportional quota sampling in Wuhan (the epidemic epicenter) and Shanghai (a nonepicenter). Data were collected from 1655 parents with children aged 3 to 17 years. Children&#039;s and adolescents&#039; prevention behaviors and regular vaccination behaviors before and during the epidemic were assessed. Descriptive analyses were used to investigate respondents&#039; characteristics, public health prevention behaviors, unproven protection behaviors, and vaccination behaviors before and during the COVID-19 epidemic. Univariate analyses were performed to compare differences in outcome measures between cities and family characteristics, using chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests (if expected frequency was &lt;5) and analyses of variance. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify the factors and disparities associated with prevention and vaccination behaviors. RESULTS: Parent-reported prevention behaviors increased among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic compared with those before the epidemic. During the epidemic, 82.2% (638/776) of children or adolescents always wore masks when going out compared with 31.5% (521/1655) before the epidemic; in addition, 25.0% (414/1655) and 79.8% (1321/1655) had increased their frequency and duration of handwashing, respectively, although only 46.9% (776/1655) went out during the epidemic. Meanwhile, 56.1% (928/1655) of the families took unproven remedies against COVID-19. Parent-reported vaccination behaviors showed mixed results, with 74.8% (468/626) delaying scheduled vaccinations and 80.9% (1339/1655) planning to have their children get the influenza vaccination after the epidemic. Regarding socioeconomic status, children and adolescents from larger families and whose parents had lower education levels were less likely to improve prevention behaviors but more likely to take unproven remedies. Girls were less likely than boys to always wear a mask when going out and wash their hands. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention behaviors and attitudes toward influenza vaccination have improved during the COVID-19 epidemic. Public health prevention measures should be continuously promoted, particularly among girls, parents with lower education levels, and larger families. Meanwhile, misinformation about COVID-19 remains a serious challenge and needs to be addressed by public health stakeholders.","Hou, Zhiyuan; Song, Suhang; Du, Fanxing; Shi, Lu; Zhang, Donglan; Lin, Leesa; Yu, Hongjie",,MEDLINE,"Adolescent Behavior; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Child Behavior; Hand Disinfection; Masks; Pandemics; Vaccination; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Epidemics; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Male; Parents; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; SARS-CoV-2; Social Class; Surveys and Questionnaires",20210706.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/26372,covidwho-1290683,2369-2960,5,JMIR Public Health Surveill,en,CA,2021.0,"JMIR Public Health Surveill;7(5): e26372, 2021 05 26.

"The study objective was to identify sociodemographic and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) factors that are associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors. Eligible participants were 18 years or older and were diagnosed with cancer as an AYA (ages 15-39 years) and received services through an AYA cancer program. A total of 342 participants completed a cross-sectional survey. Our primary outcome-COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy-was surveyed as a 5-point Likert scale and operationalized as a binary outcome (agree vs hesitant). A large proportion of participants reported COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (37.1%). In the multivariable regression, female survivors (odds ratio = 1.81, 95% confidence interval = 1.10 to 2.98) and survivors with a high school education or less (odds ratio = 3.15, 95% confidence interval = 1.41 to 7.04) reported higher odds of vaccine hesitancy compared with their male or college graduate or higher counterparts. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy persists among AYA survivors despite their recommended priority vaccination status and higher chances of severe COVID-19 outcomes.","Waters, A. R.; Kepka, D.; Ramsay, J.

"Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has still affected many countries around the world. The COVID-19 vaccine has been presented as the perfect solution for solving the current pandemic. Understanding the willingness of the community to receive the COVID-19 vaccine will help in the development and implementation of effective COVID-19 vaccination promotion programs. The aim of this study was to assess the COVID-19 vaccination acceptance and its associated factors in Sodo town, Wolaita zone, Southern Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 415 participants in Wolaita Sodo, from April 1 to 30, 2021. To collect data, structured interviewer administered questionnaire was used. A p-value &amp;lt;=0.05 in a multivariable logistic regression model was considered statistically significant. Results: Of 415 participants, 189 (45.5%) of them accepted of COVID-19 vaccines if available. Sex (AOR=2.15, 95% CI: 1.29, 3.56), educational status (AOR=3.09, 95% CI: 1.50, 6.37), mass media (AOR=1.97, 95% CI: 1.06, 3.63), received any vaccination during childhood (AOR=5.16, 95% CI: 2.44, 10.92), family members have been diagnosed with COVID-19 (AOR=4.40, 95% CI: 2.1, 9.25), friends have been diagnosed with COVID-19 (AOR=3.91, 95% CI: 1.52, 10.04), and respondents have tested for COVID-19 (AOR=4.40, 95% CI: 1.70, 11.36) were significantly associated with acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion: The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance was law. To enhance the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine, the government with different stakeholders should strengthen public education using mass media about the advantage of getting COVID-19 vaccination.","Mesele, M.",,MEDLINE,,20210706.0,https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S320771,covidwho-1291159,,,Infection &amp; Drug Resistance,en,,2021.0,"Infection &amp; Drug Resistance; 14:2361-2367, 2021.","COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptance and Its Associated Factors in Sodo Town, Wolaita Zone, Southern Ethiopia: Cross-Sectional Study",article,,,14
"As pregnant women are at high risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines are available in Switzerland, this study aimed to assess the willingness of Swiss pregnant and breastfeeding women to become vaccinated. Through a cross-sectional online study conducted after the first pandemic wave, vaccination practices and willingness to become vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 if a vaccine was available were evaluated through binary, multi-choice, and open-ended questions. Factors associated with vaccine willingness were evaluated through univariable and multivariable analysis. A total of 1551 women responded to questions related to the primary outcome. Only 29.7% (153/515) of pregnant and 38.6% (400/1036) of breastfeeding women were willing to get vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 if a vaccine had been available during the first wave. Positive predictors associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine acceptance were an age older than 40 years, a higher educational level, history of influenza vaccination within the previous year, having an obstetrician as the primary healthcare practitioner, and being in their third trimester of pregnancy. After the first pandemic wave, Switzerland had a low SARS-CoV-2 vaccination acceptance rate, emphasizing the need to identify and reduce barriers for immunization in pregnant and breastfeeding women, particularly among the youngest and those with a lower educational level.","Stuckelberger, Sarah; Favre, Guillaume; Ceulemans, Michael; Nordeng, Hedvig; Gerbier, Eva; Lambelet, Valentine; Stojanov, Milos; Winterfeld, Ursula; Baud, David; Panchaud, Alice; Pomar, L¨¦o",,MEDLINE,,20210702.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v13071199,covidwho-1289014,1999-4915,7,Viruses,en,CH,2021.0,Viruses;13(7)2021 Jun 22. ,SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Willingness among Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women during the First Pandemic Wave: A Cross-Sectional Study in Switzerland.,article,,,13
"The study aimed to determine influenza vaccine uptake among medical students and their intention to receive a hypothetical Ebola or COVID-19 vaccine. This cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was performed in 2015 and 2020 on 675 medical students at the Medical University of Warsaw, Poland. In 2020, the influenza vaccination coverage was 36.5%, and students were almost five times more likely to be vaccinated than in 2015 (OR = 4.8;95% CI: 3.1¨C7.5). In 2020, the survey was conducted during the first university campaign targeted at free influenza vaccinations for all students, as well as during the first lockdown in Poland due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, clinical students (4th¨C6th study year) were significantly more often vaccinated than preclinical students (p &amp;lt;0.001), in contrast to 2015. A majority¡ª67.0% and 94.6%¡ªof students expressed their intention to receive a hypothetical Ebola or COVID-19 vaccine, respectively. Among the medical students, influenza vaccination status was a predictor of the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Influenza vaccine uptake among medical students has increased significantly, but it is still not optimal;thus, further educational efforts are needed to convince those who are hesitant regarding vaccines. A high number of students reported their intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and it is crucial to support their positive attitude about it.","Talarek, Ewa, Warzecha, Joanna, Banasiuk, Marcin, Banaszkiewicz, Aleksandra",,MDPI,,20210702.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9070709,covidwho-1289047,,7,Vaccines,en,,2021.0,"Vaccines; 9(7):709, 2021.",Influenza Vaccination Coverage and Intention to Receive Hypothetical Ebola and COVID-19 Vaccines among Medical Students,article,,,9
"Acceptance of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination appears as a decisive factor necessary to control the ongoing pandemic. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are among the highest risk groups for infection. The current study aimed to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among HCWs in Kuwait, with identification of the psychological determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. The study was conducted using an online anonymous survey distributed between 18 March 2021 and 29 March 2021. The sampling strategy was convenience-based depending on chain-referral sampling. Psychological determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance were assessed using the 5C subscales and the Vaccine Conspiracy Beliefs Scale (VCBS). The total number of study participants was 1019, with the largest group being physicians (28.7%), pharmacists (20.2%), dentists (16.7%), and nurses (12.5%). The overall rate for COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was 83.3%, with 9.0% who were not willing to accept vaccination and 7.7% who were unsure. The highest rate for COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was seen among dentists (91.2%) and physicians (90.4%), while the lowest rate was seen among nurses (70.1%;p &amp;lt;0.001). A higher level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was found among females, participants with a lower educational level, and HCWs in the private sector. A preference for mRNA vaccine technology and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was found among the majority of participants (62.6% and 69.7%, respectively). COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was significantly linked to the embrace of vaccine conspiracy beliefs. The highest 5C psychological predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance were high levels of collective responsibility and confidence, and lower levels of constraints and calculation. The VCBS and 5C subscales (except the calculation subscale) showed acceptable levels of predicting COVID-19 vaccine acceptance based on receiver operating characteristic analyses. The participants who depended on social media platforms, TV programs, and news releases as their main sources of knowledge about COVID-19 vaccines showed higher rates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. An overall satisfactory level of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was seen among HCWs in Kuwait, which was among the highest rates reported globally. However;higher levels of vaccine hesitancy were observed among certain groups (females, nurses and laboratory workers, HCWs in the private sector), which should be targeted with more focused awareness programs. HCWs in Kuwait can play a central role in educating their patients and the general public about the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination to halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2, considering the high rates of vaccine hesitancy observed among the general public in Kuwait and the Middle East.","Al-Sanafi, Mariam, Sallam, Malik",,MDPI,,20210702.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9070701,covidwho-1289041,,7,Vaccines,en,,2021.0,"Vaccines; 9(7):701, 2021.",Psychological Determinants of COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance among Healthcare Workers in Kuwait: A Cross-Sectional Study Using the 5C and Vaccine Conspiracy Beliefs Scales,article,,,9
"Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to stop the spread of COVID-19. Understanding factors associated with intention to receive COVID-19 vaccines is the key to a successful vaccination programme. This cross-sectional study explored the rate of vaccination intention and identified its predictors using the health belief model (HBM) in the general population in Hong Kong during the pandemic. Data were collected between December 2020 and January 2021 via telephone surveys. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with intention to receive COVID-19 vaccines. A total of 1255 adults (&amp;gt;18 years, 53% female) completed the telephone survey. Overall, 42% indicated an intention to vaccinate, 31.5% showed vaccine hesitancy, and 26.5% reported refusal to receive any COVID-19 vaccines. Individuals who were men, older in age, working, with past experiences of other pandemics, less concerned with the vaccine safety, with poorer knowledge about COVID-19, and having greater levels of perceived susceptibility, self-efficacy, cues to action, and acceptance of governmental preventive measures related to COVID-19 were significantly more likely to report an intention to vaccinate. The low intention among the Hong Kong population reflects the importance of developing effective vaccination promotion campaigns with the predictors identified in this study.","Yan, Elsie, Lai, Daniel W.

"Understanding the potential impact of COVID-19 on receiving influenza vaccination among healthcare workers (HCWs) is of utmost importance. The purposes of the present cross-sectional study were to describe the characteristics and to explore the predictors of receiving influenza vaccination among a large cohort of Italian HCWs in hospital settings. Information was collected through an anonymous questionnaire from December 2020 through January 2021. General and practice characteristics, perceived risk of seasonal influenza, attitudes towards efficacy and safety of influenza vaccination, and reasons behind the decision to be vaccinated against influenza were explored. Fewer than half (46.2%) of HCWs agreed that influenza is a serious illness and perceived the risk of getting infected with influenza, and concerns about the safety of the vaccination were significant positive predictors. Fewer than half of the respondents were not concerned at all about the efficacy (48.6%) and safety (49.8%) of influenza vaccination, and 51.9% reported that they have not received a seasonal influenza vaccine during the previous season. The most mentioned reason for receiving the influenza vaccine in the current season was that influenza and COVID-19 share some similar symptoms. Study results will aid policymakers in developing vaccination education programs, promotion of trust to address negative misconceptions, and to achieve future high coverage among this high-risk group.","Della Polla, Giorgia, Licata, Francesca, Angelillo, Silvia, Pelullo, Concetta Paola, Bianco, Aida, Angelillo, Italo Francesco",,MDPI,,20210702.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9070695,covidwho-1289037,,7,Vaccines,en,,2021.0,"Vaccines; 9(7):695, 2021.",Characteristics of Healthcare Workers Vaccinated against Influenza in the Era of COVID-19,article,,,9
"Several preventive measures have been applied to limit the COVID-19 pandemic, including successful the development and introduction of vaccines. The aim of this study was to investigate adherence to preventive measures and vaccination intentions among nursing students in three European countries and the factors associated with vaccination intention and advising vaccination. A cross-sectional study using convenience/snow-ball sampling strategy was performed in Slovenia, Poland, and Serbia between 12 February and 5 March 2021. Data from 872 eligible respondents were analyzed (mean age 23.5 ¡À 6.5 years, 89% female). Higher adherence to preventive behavior was declared by those working in healthcare (p &amp;lt;0.001), engaged in COVID-19 departments (p &amp;lt;0.001), had not had the disease yet (p &amp;lt;0.001), and had children (p = 0.01). Those groups also expressed higher vaccination intention and advised vaccination to others. Higher vaccination intention and advising vaccination were mostly associated with belief in benefits of vaccine, trust in institutions, perceived effectiveness of vaccine, influence of social environment, protection of patients and perceived health care professionals¡¯ duty. Fear of side effects and general refusal of vaccines are the main reasons for vaccination hesitancy. The results of the study indicate how higher education institutions can support the development of appropriate professional attitudes and behaviors among nursing students.","Kregar Velikonja, Nevenka, Dobrowolska, Beata, Stanisavljevi?, Sanja, Erjavec, Karmen, Globevnik Velikonja, Vislava, Verdenik, Ivan",,MDPI,,20210702.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9070781,covidwho-1288847,,7,Healthcare,en,,2021.0,"Healthcare; 9(7):781, 2021.",Attitudes of Nursing Students towards Vaccination and Other Preventive Measures for Limitation of COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-Sectional Study in Three European Countries,article,,,9
"PURPOSE: The current study investigated how risk exposures, risk perceptions of COVID-19, and negative attitudes toward general vaccination were related to COVID vaccine acceptance among college students. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Data was collected by online survey using RedCap among college students in South Carolina between September 2020 and October 2020. SAMPLE: 1062 college students in South Carolina. MEASURES: risk exposures to COVID-19, perceived severity of COVID-19, perceived susceptibility of COVID-19, negative attitude toward general vaccination, vaccine acceptance of COVID-19. ANALYSIS: Hierarchical linear regression was used to examine the association of these factors with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance controlling for key demographics. RESULTS: Perceived severity of COVID-19 was positively associated with vaccine acceptance (? = 0.19, p &lt; 0.001). Higher level of risk exposures (? = -0.08, p = 0.007) and negative attitude toward general vaccination (? = -0.38, p &lt; 0.001) were associated with low vaccine acceptance. CONCLUSION: We need tailored education messages for college students to emphasize the severity of COVID-19, address the concerns of side effects of general vaccines by dispelling the misconception, and target the most vulnerable subgroups who reported high level of risk exposures while showed low intention to take the vaccine.","Qiao, Shan; Tam, Cheuk Chi; Li, Xiaoming",,MEDLINE,,20210701.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08901171211028407,covidwho-1286789,2168-6602,,Am J Health Promot,en,US,2021.0,"Am J Health Promot;: 8901171211028407, 2021 Jun 24.

"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines are being administered around the world; however, lactating women were excluded from SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials. Therefore, knowledge about the effect of vaccination in this specific group is limited. This information is essential to empower lactating women to make a well-informed decision on their choice for vaccination. After natural infection, SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies are present in human milk, which might offer protection for her newborn. The dynamics of these antibodies in human milk following vaccination remain to be elucidated. RESEARCH AIM: To determine the effect of vaccination with BNT162b2 on the levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA in human milk. METHODS: In this prospective longitudinal study, we included lactating women who received the BNT162b2 vaccine. Human milk samples were collected prior to vaccination and 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 days after both vaccine doses. Samples were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: In total, 366 human milk samples from 26 lactating women were analyzed. A biphasic response was observed, with SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) starting to increase between day 5 and 7 after the first dose of the vaccine. After the second dose, an accelerated IgA antibody response was observed. CONCLUSION: After vaccination with the mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine, a SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody response was observed in human milk. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA after vaccination is important as antibodies are transferred via human milk, and thereby might provide protection to infants against COVID-19.","Juncker, Hannah G; Mulleners, Sien J; van Gils, Marit J; de Groot, Christianne J M; Pajkrt, Dasja; Korosi, Aniko; van Goudoever, Johannes B; van Keulen, Britt J",,MEDLINE,,20210630.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08903344211027112,covidwho-1285158,1552-5732,,J Hum Lact,en,US,2021.0,"J Hum Lact;: 8903344211027112, 2021 Jun 27.

"BACKGROUND: Considering the potential COVID-19 impact on pwMS health and the importance of vaccination for this population, we decided to assess: (a) pwMS&#039; beliefs and knowledge on COVID-19 pandemic; (b) their acceptance towards COVID-19 vaccination and (c) pwMS&#039; opinions on general vaccination. METHODS: Observational study, based on a cross-sectional (10-20th September 2020) online survey, conducted in a cohort of pwMS&#039; followed at two Portuguese hospitals. The survey included measures to characterize the sample and a questionnaire designed to assess the topics defined for this study. RESULTS: 270 respondents completed the full survey (response rate 58.2%). pwMS greatest concern during the pandemic was an aggravation of MS, especially by patients older than 50 years old. Almost 40% of the patients older than 50 felt that the pandemic negatively affected their MS related medical assistance. Most patients believed they would recover from COVID-19 infection. More than half of the responders feared a MS aggravation if they got COVID-19; this was more pronounced in patients with progressive MS. About 12% of the participants did not want to be vaccinated and almost 40% was unsure. Regarding vaccines in general, almost a third of the participants feared their side effects or MS related complications.

"BACKGROUND: Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) is a rare subtype of transverse myelitis (TM) that potentially results in relevant disability. Apart from association to neuromyelitis optica and other chronic demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system, many other aetiologies are known. Particularly systemic infections and vaccination are considered potential triggers for immune mediated inflammation of the spinal cord. In the course of the current Covid-19 pandemic several cases of TM following Covid-19 infection have been described. Here we present a case of LETM following vaccination against Covid-19 with AZD1222, AstraZeneca. An extensive diagnostic work up was performed to rule out alternative causes, including prior and current Covid-19 infection. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge this is first case of LETM possibly related to Covid-19 vaccination that is published after marketing authorisation of various vaccine candidates.","Pagenkopf, Claudia; S¨¹dmeyer, Martin",,MEDLINE,,20210630.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneuroim.2021.577606,covidwho-1284235,1872-8421,,J Neuroimmunol,en,NL,2021.0,"J Neuroimmunol;358: 577606, 2021 Jun 24.

"Objective The objective of this study was to assess community pharmacists&#039; willingness to test, treat and immunize for COVID-19 in Puerto Rico. Methods In this cross-sectional study, a 37-item survey was distributed via email and social media in May 2020 through REDCap online software. All licensed community pharmacists in Puerto Rico (N = 1200) were invited to complete the survey. Retired community pharmacists were excluded. Analysis of frequencies and chi-square tests were performed to evaluate the willingness to test, treat and immunize for COVID-19 and their associations with sociodemographic variables. Key findings The survey response rate was 26% (314/1200). Subjects&#039; mean age was 42 (13), 86.1% were female, and most practiced in independent community or specialty pharmacy (62%). Among respondents, 44% reported willingness to test. Top concerns for testing were family (73.4%) and self (66.8%) exposure and ability to manage the workflow (53.3%). Most participants indicated their willingness to treat (88.4%) and to administer the COVID-19 vaccine (76.1%). Study participants who worked in retail pharmacies were more willing to test for COVID-19 (50.9%, P = 0.34) and to immunize (91.2%, P &amp;lt; 0.001). Pharmacists &amp;lt;= 39 years (90.3%), those who graduate in 2000 or later (88.3%), and those with a Pharm.D. degree or higher (88.6%), were more willing to immunize (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions Most community pharmacists were more willing to treat and immunize, than to perform COVID-19 testing. This underscores the need for training and workflow changes to facilitate the acquisition of this new role. Local pharmacists&#039; associations should advocate for a safe and manageable work environment. These efforts are vital to empower pharmacists to adopt new roles during a public health emergency.","Silva-Suarez, G.; Reyes, Y. A.; Colon-Pratts, F. M.; Sanchez, J.; Ortiz, B. I.; Rabionet, S.

"BACKGROUND: Despite SARS-CoV-2 immunizations have started in most countries, children are not currently included in the vaccination programs, thus it remains crucial to define their anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response in order to minimize the risk for other epidemic waves. This study seeks to provide a description of the virology ad anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity in children with distinct symptomatology. METHODS: Between March and July 2020, we recruited 15 SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic (AS) and 51 symptomatic children (SY), stratified according to WHO clinical classification. We measured SARS-CoV-2 viral load using ddPCR and qPCR in longitudinally collected nasopharyngeal swabs samples. To define anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies we measured neutralization?activity and total IgG load (Diasorin). We also evaluated antigen-specific B and CD8+T-cells, using a labelled S1+S2 protein and ICAM expression, respectively. Plasma protein profiling was performed with Olink. RESULTS: Virological profiling showed that AS had lower viral load at diagnosis (p=0.004) and faster virus clearance (p=0.0002) compared to SY. Anti-SARS CoV-2 humoral and cellular response did not appear to be associated with the presence of symptoms. AS and SY showed similar titers of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, levels of neutralizing activity, and frequency of Ag-specific B and CD8+T-cells. Whereas pro-inflammatory plasma protein profile was associated to symptomatology. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral and cellular response with any regards to symptomatology, suggesting the ability of both SY and AS to contribute towards herd immunity. The virological profiling of AS suggested that they have lower virus load associated with faster virus clearance.","Cotugno, Nicola; Ruggiero, Alessandra; Pascucci, Giuseppe Rubens; Bonfante, Francesco; Petrara, Maria Raffaella; Pighi, Chiara; Cifaldi, Loredana; Zangari, Paola; Bernardi, Stefania; Cursi, Laura; Santilli, Veronica; Manno, Emma Concetta; Amodio, Donato; Linardos, Giulia; Piccioni, Livia; Barbieri, Maria Antonietta; Perrotta, Daniela; Campana, Andrea; Don¨¤, Daniele; Giaquinto, Carlo; Concato, Carlo; Brodin, Petter; Rossi, Paolo; De Rossi, Anita; Palma, Paolo",,MEDLINE,,20210629.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pai.13585,covidwho-1282025,1399-3038,,Pediatr. allergy immunol,en,GB,2021.0,Pediatr Allergy Immunol;2021 Jun 26. ,Virological and immunological features of SARS-COV-2 infected children with distinct symptomatology.,article,,,
"Background: The impact of COVID-19 vaccination on breastfeeding is unknown. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether vaccine-related side effects following COVID-19 vaccination were associated with an adverse impact on breastfeeding. Secondarily, we sought to determine perceived symptoms in breastfed children and maternal opinion about COVID-19 vaccination. Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of breastfeeding mothers who underwent COVID-19 vaccination &gt;2 days before the survey. Subjects were recruited through social media and websites. Data included sociodemographic information, vaccine history, maternal and child symptoms, and impact on lactation/breastfeeding. Bivariate statistics (chi-square, Wilcoxon rank sum, and t tests) and multivariable logistic regression models examined the association of vaccine side effects with lactation, symptoms in breastfed children, and maternal opinion on vaccination. Results: Analysis included 4,455 breastfeeding mothers. Maternal postvaccination symptoms were more common after the second dose (p &lt; 0.001). Overall, 77 (1.7%) respondents reported a negative impact on breastfeeding postvaccination, and these mothers were more likely to have experienced fatigue, headache, muscle pain, injection site pain, chills, fever, or allergic reactions. After adjusting for confounding variables, higher odds of an adverse impact on lactation were associated with lower breastfeeding intensity, dose of vaccine, and child symptoms. Even among mothers who reported an adverse impact on breastfeeding, maternal opinion about vaccination and confidence in their decision to receive the COVID-19 vaccine were high. Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccination among breastfeeding mothers resulted in minimal disruption of lactation or adverse impact on the breastfed child. These findings may be considered in vaccination decision-making.","McLaurin-Jiang, Skyler; Garner, Christine D; Krutsch, Kaytlin; Hale, Thomas W",,MEDLINE,,20210629.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/bfm.2021.0079,covidwho-1281838,1556-8342,,Breastfeed. med,en,US,2021.0,Breastfeed Med;2021 Jun 25. ,Maternal and Child Symptoms Following COVID-19 Vaccination Among Breastfeeding Mothers.,article,,,
"Objective: The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) is one of the most robust models in explaining health-related behavior. In this study, we tested the extended TPB to predict university students&#039; intentions to uptake COVID-19 vaccination.Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was developed to investigate students&#039; intention to uptake the COVID-19 vaccine based on the components of the TPB (i.e., attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control) and extended components (i.e., knowledge about COVID-19, risk perception of COVID-19, and past influenza vaccination behavior). Non-probability sampling was used to collect data from 3145 students from 43 universities in mainland China in January 2021. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to examine the proposed model. Enrolled students were relatively young (mean age?=?20.80?years; SD?=?2.09), half of them are female (50.2%), and most of them were studying in undergraduate programs (n?=?3026; 96.2%).Results: The results showed that students&#039; knowledge of the COVID-19 vaccine and risk perception of COVID-19 positively influenced their attitude toward the uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine. Also, students&#039; attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination uptake and their past influenza vaccination uptake behaviors were positively associated with the intention to uptake COVID-19 vaccination. Subjective norm and perceived behavioral control were not significant predictors for the intention to uptake COVID-19 vaccination (R2?=?0.49).Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that the extended TPB appears to be an efficient model with the focus on attitude, knowledge, risk perception, and past influenza vaccination uptake behaviors in explaining students&#039; intention for COVID-19 vaccination.","Fan, Chia-Wei; Chen, I-Hua; Ko, Nai-Ying; Yen, Cheng-Fang; Lin, Chung-Ying; Griffiths, Mark D; Pakpour, Amir H",,MEDLINE,,20210629.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1933687,covidwho-1281831,2164-554X,,Hum Vaccin Immunother,en,US,2021.0,"Hum Vaccin Immunother;: 1-8, 2021 Jun 25.

"BACKGROUND: Scientists across the world are working on innovating a successful vaccine that will save lives and end COVID-19 pandemic. World Health Organization (WHO) is working to make sure COVID-19 vaccines can be safely delivered to all those who need them. Indeed, the successful deployment and a sufficient uptake of vaccines is equally important. Acceptance and accessibility of such vaccine is a key indicator of vaccination coverage. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the determinants of intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine among school teachers in Gondar City. METHODS: An institution based cross-sectional study was conducted from December, 2020 to January, 2021. A total of 301 school teachers selected using stratified simple random sampling were included. Descriptive analysis such as medians, means, proportions, standard deviations and frequencies were computed. Linear regression analysis was done to identify factors associated with intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine. A p-value of less than 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. RESULTS: The median intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine was 3.33 with interquartile range of 2.67-4.0. Of the participants 54.8% had scored above the median of intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine score. 54% variance in intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine was explained by the independent variables. Being affiliated with other category of religion, bachelor degree educational status, perceived susceptibility, perceived benefit, perceived barrier, and cues to action were significantly associated with the intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSION: The median score of intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine was 3.33. Socio-demographic and health beliefs influenced the intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in the study participant. Policy makers and stakeholders should focus on strong health promotion about risks of the pandemic, benefit, safety, and efficacy of vaccination.","Handebo, Simegnew; Wolde, Maereg; Shitu, Kegnie; Kassie, Ayenew",,MEDLINE,,20210629.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253499,covidwho-1282301,1932-6203,6,PLoS One,en,US,2021.0,"PLoS One;16(6): e0253499, 2021.

"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 serological testing has seen extensive academic and clinical use from investigating correlates of immunity to seroprevalence, convalescent plasma and vaccine trials. Interpretation of these studies will depend on robust validation of the longitudinal sensitivities of these assays, especially in the context of mild disease which makes up the majority of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caseload. METHODS: Hospital staff (n=94) returning to work following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed COVID-19 were offered antibody testing to assist with laboratory verification. Initial specimens were collected at median 29 days post-symptom onset and run on the Roche, Abbott, Siemens and DiaSorin platforms. Re-sampling occurred at median 142 days from a subset of the initial cohort (n=62) that had volunteered to provide further sera to assist in longitudinal sensitivity analysis. Samples that were not run across all four platforms were excluded from analysis. RESULTS: Comparative sensitivity analysis was conducted on 89/94 of the initial specimens and 55/62 of the repeat specimens. Sensitivity at initial sampling ranged from 78-87% across platforms. At re-sampling, sensitivities were: 100% (Roche), 45% (Abbott), 100% (Siemens), and 80% (DiaSorin). Paired analysis using the longitudinal cohort (n=55) demonstrated stable or increasing median assay values on three platforms, with a clear reduction seen only on the Abbott platform (4.78 to 1.34) with corresponding sensitivity drop-off (81.8% to 45.4%). CONCLUSION: The Abbott assay demonstrated sensitivity drop-off and decrease in median assay signal below detection threshold at 4-5 months. This has implications on the interpretation and design of future studies.","Sim, Marcus Yee Lu; Cockcroft, Christopher; Darby, Denise; Ellis, Clare Roisin; Heaps, Adrian; Scargill, Jonathan; Garcez, Tomaz",,MEDLINE,,20210629.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00045632211030957,covidwho-1282198,1758-1001,,Ann Clin Biochem,en,GB,2021.0,"Ann Clin Biochem;: 45632211030957, 2021 Jun 24.

"Background: In the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the expansion of the more transmissible 20J/501Y.V3 (Gamma) variant of concern (VOC), mRNA vaccines have been made available in French Guiana, an overseas French territory in South America, from mid-January 2021. This study aimed to estimate the willingness to be vaccinated and the socio-demographic and motivational correlates among Health Care Workers (HCWs) in French Guiana. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from January 22 to March 26, 2021 among a sample of HCWs in French Guiana. They were asked about their willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and vaccine hesitancy, vaccine uptake and vaccines attitudes. Factors associated with willingness to get vaccinated have been analyzed with ordinal logistic regression, using Stata software. Results: A total of 579 HCWs were interviewed, including 220 physicians and 200 nurses most often working in hospital (54%) or in the liberal sector (22%). Overall, 65.6% of respondents reported that they were willing or had already been vaccinated against COVID-19, while 24.3% of respondents reported that they did not want to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and 11.2% were unsure. HCWs were more willing to get vaccine if they were older, were worried about COVID-19 and were confident in the management of epidemic. Conversely, participants were less likely to have been vaccinated or willing to if they were nurses or of another non-medical profession, born in French Guiana, feared adverse effects, or if they did not trust pharmaceutical companies and management of the epidemic by authorities. Conclusion: Negative attitudes towards vaccines are a major public health concern among HCWs in French Guiana when considering the current active epidemic with Gamma VOC. General vaccine hesitancy and concerns about future side effects in particular represent important barriers. Low confidence in government and science are significant in COVID-19 vaccine refusal among non-medical staffs. Public health messaging with information on vaccine safety should be tailored to address these concerns. The specific challenges of HCWs from French Guiana must be taken into account.","Vignier, Nicolas, Brureau, Kepha, Granier, Sybille, Breton, Jacques, Michaud, C¨¦line, Gaillet, M¨¦lanie, Agostini, Camille, Ballet, Mathilde, Nacher, Mathieu, Valdes, Audrey, Abboud, Philippe, Adenis, Antoine, Djossou, F¨¦lix, Epelboin, Lo?c, Douine, Maylis",,ProQuest Central,,20210629.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9060682,covidwho-1282661,,6,Vaccines,en,,2021.0,"Vaccines; 9(6):682, 2021.",Attitudes towards the COVID-19 Vaccine and Willingness to Get Vaccinated among Healthcare Workers in French Guiana: The Influence of Geographical Origin,article,,,9
"We investigated the COVID-19 vaccination acceptance level in Azuay province, Ecuador through an online survey from 12th to 26th February (before the start of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Ecuador). Overall, 1219 respondents participated in the survey. The mean age was 32 ¡À 13 years;693 participants (57%) were female. In total, 1109 (91%) of the participants indicated they were willing to be vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, if the vaccine is at least 95% effective;835 (68.5%) if it is 90% effective and 493 (40.5%) if it is 70% effective;676 (55.5%) participants indicated they feared side effects and 237 (19.4%) thought the vaccine was not effective. Older age, having had a postgraduate education, a history of a negative COVID-19 test, a high level of worry of contracting COVID-19, believing that COVID-19 infection can be prevented with a vaccine and understanding there is currently an effective vaccine against COVID-19 were associated with higher vaccination acceptance.

"Background: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is a serious threat to mass vaccination strategies that need to be accelerated currently in order to achieve a substantial level of community immunity. Independent (non-sponsored) studies have a great potential to enhance public confidence in vaccines and accelerate their uptake process. Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional study for the side effects (SE) of CoronaVac was carried out in February 2021 among Turkish healthcare workers who were recently vaccinated. The questionnaire inquired about local and systemic SEs that occurred in the short-term, within four weeks, following vaccination. Results: A total of 780 healthcare workers were included in this study;62.5% of them experienced at least one SE. Injection site pain (41.5%) was the most common local SE, while fatigue (23.6%), headache (18.7%), muscle pain (11.2%) and joint pain (5.9%) were the common systemic SEs. Female healthcare workers (67.9%) were significantly more affected by local and systemic SEs than male colleagues (51.4%). Younger age, previous infection, and compromised health status (chronic illnesses and regular medicines uptake) can be associated with an increased risk of CoronaVac SEs;Conclusions: The independent research shows a higher prevalence of CoronaVac SEs than what is reported by phase I¨CIII clinical trials. In general, the results of this study confirm the overall safety of CoronaVac and suggest potential risk factors for its SEs. Gender-based differences and SEs distribution among age groups are worth further investigation.","Abanoub, Riad, Sa??ro?lu, Derya, &amp;Uuml;st¨¹n, Batuhan, Pokorn¨¢, Andrea, Klugarov¨¢, Jitka, Attia, Sameh, Klugar, Miloslav",,ProQuest Central,,20210629.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10122629,covidwho-1282521,,12,Journal of Clinical Medicine,en,,2021.0,"Journal of Clinical Medicine; 10(12):2629, 2021.",Prevalence and Risk Factors of CoronaVac Side Effects: An Independent Cross-Sectional Study among Healthcare Workers in Turkey,article,,,10
"Background: Dynamics and persistence of neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies can give us the knowledge required for serodiagnosis, disease management, and successful vaccine design and development. The disappearance of antibodies, absence of humoral immunity activation, and sporadic reinfection cases emphasize the importance of longitudinal antibody dynamics against variable structural antigens. Methods: In this study, twenty-five healthy subjects working in a SARS-COV-2 serodiagnostic assay development project were enrolled, and their sign and symptoms were followed up to six months. Three subjects showed COVID-19-like symptoms, and three subjects&#039; antibody dynamics were followed over 120 days by analyzing 516 samples. We have developed 12 different types of in-house ELISAs to observe the kinetics of IgG, IgM, and IgA against four SARS-CoV-2 proteins, namely nucleocapsid, RBD, S1, and whole spike (S1+S2). For the development of these assays, 30-104 pre-pandemic samples were taken as negative controls and 83 RT-qPCR positive samples as positive ones. Results: All three subjects presented COVID-19-like symptoms twice, with mild symptoms in the first episode were severe in the second, and RT-qPCR confirmed the latter. The initial episode did not culminate with any significant antibody development, while a multifold increase in IgG antibodies characterized the second episode. Interestingly, IgG antibody development concurrent with IgM and IgA and persisted, whereas the latter two weans off rather quickly if appeared. Conclusion: Antibody kinetics observed in this study can provide a pathway to the successful development of sero-diagnostics and epidemiologists to predict the fate of vaccination currently in place.","Jamiruddin, M.

"Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a deadly virus that continues to afflict many countries worldwide. The development of a COVID-19 vaccine to combat the disease&#039;s spread and devastating effects is still ongoing, and as the pandemic progresses, new, more effective vaccines are likely to be created. The aim of this study was to assess awareness and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination in Ethiopia. Methods: A population-based cross-sectional e-survey was conducted among 425 participants from March 13, 2021 to April 10, 2021. The survey was conducted using a structured and self-reported questionnaire containing informed consent along with three sections (socio-demographic, awareness, and attitude);a multivariable logistic regression model was performed to determine the variables predicting awareness towards COVID-19 vaccinations. Results: The mean score of awareness was 4.3 (SD=1.1) out of 7, with the overall awareness of 40.8%, and the mean score of attitudes was 4.09 (SD=2.16) out of 9, with an overall &quot;positive attitude&quot; score of 24.2%.

"Although vaccines are among the most effective interventions used in fighting diseases, vaccination readiness varies substantially among individuals. Vaccination readiness is defined as a set of components that increase or decrease AN individual&#039;s likelihood of getting vaccinated. Building on earlier work that distinguished five components of vaccination readiness (confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility), we revised the questionnaire used to measure these components to improve its psychometric properties, specifically criterion validity. In doing so, we also developed two new components of vaccination readiness: compliance and conspiracy. Compliance is the tendency to support monitoring to control adherence to regulations;conspiracy is the tendency to endorse conspiratorial beliefs about vaccination. The newly introduced 7C scale was initially piloted in a cascade of serial cross-sectional studies and then validated with N = 681 participants from the COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring in Denmark. We report a bifactor measurement model, convergent validity with other questionnaires, and an explanation of 85% variance in the willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19. We also present a 7-item short version of the scale.

"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the perception, confidence, hesitancy and acceptance rate of various COVID-19 vaccine types among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Saudi Arabia, a nation with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus experience. DESIGN: National cross-sectional, pilot-validated questionnaire. SETTING: Online, self-administered questionnaire among HCWs. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2007 HCWs working in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia participated; 1512 (75.3%) participants completed the survey and were included in the analysis. INTERVENTION: Data were collected through an online survey sent to HCWs during 1-15 November 2020. The main outcome measure was HCW acceptance of COVID-19 candidate vaccines. The associated factors of vaccination acceptance were identified through a logistic regression analysis and via measurement of the level of anxiety, using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 scale. RESULTS: Among the 1512 HCWs who were included, 62.4% were women, 70.3% were between 21 and 40 years of age, and the majority (62.2%) were from tertiary hospitals. In addition, 59.5% reported knowing about at least one vaccine; 24.4% of the participants were sure about their willingness to receive the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, and 20.9% were willing to receive the RNA BNT162b2 vaccine. However, 18.3% reported that they would refuse to receive the Ad5-vectored vaccine, and 17.9% would refuse the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine. Factors that influenced the differential readiness of HCWs included their perceptions of the vaccine&#039;s efficiency in preventing the infection (33%), their personal preferences (29%) and the vaccine&#039;s manufacturing country (28.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Awareness by HCWs of the several COVID-19 candidate vaccines could improve their perceptions and acceptance of vaccination. Reliable sources on vaccine efficiency could improve vaccine uptake, so healthcare authorities should use reliable information to decrease vaccine hesitancy among frontline healthcare providers.","Temsah, Mohamad-Hani; Barry, Mazin; Aljamaan, Fadi; Alhuzaimi, Abdullah; Al-Eyadhy, Ayman; Saddik, Basema; Alrabiaah, Abdulkarim; Alsohime, Fahad; Alhaboob, Ali; Alhasan, Khalid; Alaraj, Ali; Halwani, Rabih; Alamro, Nurah Maziad; Al-Shahrani, Fatimah S; Jamal, Amr; Alsubaie, Sarah; Memish, Ziad A; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A",,MEDLINE,COVID-19 Vaccines; COVID-19; Adenoviridae; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Perception; RNA; SARS-CoV-2; Saudi Arabia; Surveys and Questionnaires,20210628.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048586,covidwho-1280432,2044-6055,6,BMJ Open,en,GB,2021.0,"BMJ Open;11(6): e048586, 2021 06 21.

"Studies of two SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines suggested that they yield a??95% protection from symptomatic infection at least short-term, but important clinical questions remain. It is unclear how vaccine-induced antibody levels quantitatively compare to the wide spectrum induced by natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccine response kinetics and magnitudes in persons with prior COVID-19 compared to virus-nai¨¬?ve persons are not well-defined. The relative stability of vaccine-induced versus infection-induced antibody levels is unclear. We addressed these issues with longitudinal assessments of vaccinees with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection using quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of anti-RBD antibodies. SARS-CoV-2-nai¨¬?ve individuals achieved levels similar to mild natural infection after the first vaccination; a second dose generated levels approaching severe natural infection. In persons with prior COVID-19, one dose boosted levels to the high end of severe natural infection even in those who never had robust responses from infection, increasing no further after the second dose. Antiviral neutralizing assessments using a spike-pseudovirus assay revealed that virus-nai¨¬?ve vaccinees did not develop physiologic neutralizing potency until the second dose, while previously infected persons exhibited maximal neutralization after one dose. Finally, antibodies from vaccination waned similarly to natural infection, resulting in an average of a??90% loss within 90 days. In summary, our findings suggest that two doses are important for quantity and quality of humoral immunity in SARS-CoV-2-nai¨¬?ve persons, while a single dose has maximal effects in those with past infection. Antibodies from vaccination wane with kinetics very similar to that seen after mild natural infection; booster vaccinations will likely be required.","Ibarrondo, F Javier; Hofmann, Christian; Fulcher, Jennifer A; Goodman-Meza, David; Mu, William; Hausner, Mary Ann; Ali, Ayub; Balamurugan, Arumugam; Taus, Ellie; Elliott, Julie; Krogstad, Paul; Tobin, Nicole H; Ferbas, Kathie G; Kitchen, Scott G; Aldrovandi, Grace M; Rimoin, Anne W; Yang, Otto O",,MEDLINE,,20210628.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.1c03972,covidwho-1279811,1936-086X,,ACS nano,en,US,2021.0,ACS Nano;2021 Jun 23. ,"Primary, Recall, and Decay Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Antibody Responses.",article,,,
"INTRODUCTION: Concerns are prevailing about the safety and side effects of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A randomized, cross-sectional study was performed to investigate the side effects of the BNT162b2 vaccine using an independent online questionnaire gathering responses from healthcare workers (HCWs) with detailed review of organ systems. RESULTS: Of all HCWs, 87.98% (1245/1415) completed the survey. Of them, 64.5% (803/1245) received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and reported at least one or more symptoms (classified based on organ systems and occurrence rate) post vaccination. Of these, 640/803 (79.7%) were able to continue activities of daily living (ADL), 103/803 (12.83%) had trouble temporarily to perform ADL, 99/803 (12.33%) took time off work temporarily, 20/803 (2.49%) required help from an outpatient provider, 5/803 (0.62%) required help from an emergency department and 2/803 (0.25%) required hospitalization. Despite this, 97.61% intended to have the second dose and 92.9% had already received it. CONCLUSIONS: Commonly reported symptoms (occurrence in descending order) were soreness, fatigue, myalgia, headache, chills, fever, joint pain, nausea, muscle spasm, sweating, dizziness, flushing, feelings of relief, brain fogging, anorexia, localized swelling, decreased sleep quality, itching, tingling, diarrhoea, nasal stuffiness and palpitations. Despite this, remarkable acceptance for the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine was found among HCWs.","Kadali, Renuka A K; Janagama, Ravali; Peruru, Sharanya; Malayala, Srikrishna V",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19 Vaccines/adverse effects; RNA, Messenger/adverse effects; Self Report; Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Fatigue/etiology; Health Personnel/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Humans; RNA, Messenger/genetics",20210628.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.04.047,covidwho-1279608,1878-3511,,Int J Infect Dis,en,CA,2021.0,"Int J Infect Dis;106: 376-381, 2021 May.

"BACKGROUND: Research suggests that preventive measures are critical to reducing the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but evidence regarding the association between trust in government and the practice of preventive measures is limited. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the practice of preventive measures against COVID-19 differs by one&#039;s level of trust in government. DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis using the Japan COVID-19 and Society Internet Survey (JACSIS) conducted in August and September 2020. PARTICIPANTS: A nationally representative sample of Japanese individuals aged 15 through 79 years. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was the composite score for COVID-19 preventive measures, defined as the percentage of preventive measures an individual reported to be practicing (out of nine measures: social distancing, wearing masks, avoiding closed spaces, avoiding crowded spaces, avoiding close contact settings, hand washing, avoiding touching one&#039;s face, respiratory hygiene, and surface disinfection). The secondary outcomes were (1) support for stay-at-home requests, (2) use of a contact-tracing app, and (3) receipt of the influenza vaccine in the previous season. KEY RESULTS: Our analysis included a total of 25,482 individuals. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that individuals with high trust in government were likely to practice preventive measures more frequently compared to those with low trust (adjusted composite scores, 83.8% for high- vs. 79.5% for low-trust individuals; adjusted difference, +4.3 percentage points [pp]; 95% CI, +2.4 to +6.2pp; P&lt;0.001). We also found that high trust in government was associated with higher likelihoods of support for stay-at-home requests, use of a contact-tracing app, and receipt of the influenza vaccine in the previous season. CONCLUSIONS: High trust in government was associated with a higher intensity of practicing COVID-19 preventive measures among Japanese individuals at the national level. Our findings may provide useful information to develop and design effective public health interventions.","Gotanda, Hiroshi; Miyawaki, Atsushi; Tabuchi, Takahiro; Tsugawa, Yusuke",,MEDLINE,,20210628.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11606-021-06959-3,covidwho-1279485,1525-1497,,J. gen. intern. med,en,US,2021.0,J Gen Intern Med;2021 Jun 22. ,Association Between Trust in Government and Practice of Preventive Measures During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan.,article,,,
"Background: Beliefs of an individual about health conditions can play an important role in contributing to their behavior concerning good and bad health practices. The aim of this study was to develop and assess a set of vaccination belief scales in relation to COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between July 2020 and January 2021 using a systematic random sampling of 425 adult outpatients at two hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. An instrument was designed based on the dimensional structure and wording of the health belief model (HBM), which was followed by the assessment of the instrument¡¯s internal consistency and the construct validity. Results: The 15-item instrument showed the content validity index (CVI) of scales reached a value of 1.0. Exploratory factor analysis was performed on the first sample (n = 170) and extracted 12 out of 15 draft items in a four-factor model (threat of disease, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and cues to action) that accounted for 68.3% of the total variance. Cronbach¡¯s alpha coefficient of 0.765 showed as satisfactory. Following this, the confirmatory factor analysis in the remaining sample (n = 255) found a good fit between a four-factor model and a theoretical model of HBM with acceptable values of fit indices. Conclusion: Beliefs scales for COVID-19 vaccination have been determined to be valid and reliable. They can be a helpful instrument for health educators to use for assessing immunization beliefs of individuals and the public where there is the need to implement new vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccine, before they are used more widely across the community.","Huynh, Giao, Han Thi Ngoc, Nguyen, Vien Truong, Nguyen, An Le, Pham",,ProQuest Central,,20210628.0,https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S301645,covidwho-1280692,,,Risk Management and Healthcare Policy,en,,2021.0,"Risk Management and Healthcare Policy; 14:2517-2526, 2021.","Development and Psychometric Properties of the Health Belief Scales Toward COVID-19 Vaccine in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",article,,,14

"BACKGROUND: Individuals with a substance use disorder (SUD) are at a significantly higher risk for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and have higher rates of COVID-19 related hospitalization and death than those without SUD. This study assessed COVID-19 vaccine trust, transmission awareness, risk and protective behaviors, and effects of COVID-19 on mental health and smoking among a sample of clients in California residential SUD treatment programs and identified factors associated with vaccine trust. METHODS: A multi-site sample of SUD treatment clients (n = 265) completed a cross-sectional survey. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine trust. RESULTS: Participants were predominantly male (82.3 %) and racially/ethnically diverse (33.3 % Non-Hispanic White). Most participants were aware of COVID-19 modes of transmission, however, only 39.5 % trusted a COVID-19 vaccine would be safe and effective. Factors independently associated with trust in a COVID-19 vaccine included age (AOR = 1.03, 95 % CI = 1.02, 1.05, p = 0.0001) and wearing a mask all the time (AOR = 2.48, 95 % CI = 1.86, 3.31, p = 0.0001). African Americans were less likely than White participants to trust that a COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective (AOR = 0.41, 95 % CI = 0.23, 0.70, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: SUD treatment clients were aware of COVID-19 modes of transmission; however, fewer than half trusted that a COVID-19 vaccine would be safe and effective. Health communication about COVID-19 for people with SUD should use a multipronged approach to address COVID-19 vaccine mistrust and transmission risk behaviors.","Masson, Carmen L; McCuistian, Caravella; Straus, Elana; Elahi, Sania; Chen, Maggie; Gruber, Valerie A; Le, Thao; Guydish, Joseph",,MEDLINE,,20210624.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108812,covidwho-1275264,1879-0046,,Drug Alcohol Depend,en,IE,2021.0,"Drug Alcohol Depend;225: 108812, 2021 Jun 18.

"BACKGROUND: At the beginning of March 2020, Cameroon experienced its first cases of infection with the new coronavirus (SARS-COV-2). Very quickly, there was a drop in the rate of hospital attendance. The purpose of this study was to observe the variations in the uptake of pediatric consultations and vaccinations in a pediatric hospital. METHODS: A descriptive and retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out using consultation and vaccination statistics from a pediatric hospital in the city of Yaound¨¦, political capital of Cameroon, from January 2016 to May 2020. Data were entered in Microsoft Excel and exported to R software (Version 3.3.3) for statistical analysis. First, time series raw data (before and after COVID-19) were plotted and the trend estimated by locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) methods. Then a classic seasonal decomposition was performed to distinguish between seasonal trends and irregular components using moving averages. The Webel-Ollech overall seasonality test (WO test) was also run to formally check for seasonality. The results of the study are presented as narrative tables and graphs. RESULTS: Following the partial confinement recommended by the government of Cameroon, the number of pediatric consultations decreased by 52% in April and by 34% in May 2020 compared with rates during the same periods in 2019 (P=0.00001). For antenatal visits, the rates dropped by 45% and 34%, respectively, in April and May 2020 compared with 2019. The demand for immunization services also declined. As a result, the demand for BCG vaccines, third-dose tracer vaccines (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis), polio, and MMR in children as well as tetanus vaccines in childbearing women dropped significantly. CONCLUSION: The start of the COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by a significant drop in consultation and vaccination activities. If no action is taken to correct this phenomenon, the ensuing months could be marked by a considerable increase in patients, sometimes suffering from vaccine-preventable diseases. The death rate could increase considerably in the pediatric population.","Chelo, D; Nguefack, F; Enyama, D; Nansseu, R; Feudjo Tefoueyet, G; Mbassi Awa, H D; Mekone Nkwelle, I; Nguefack-Tsague, G; Ndenbe, P; Koki Ndombo, P O",,MEDLINE,,20210624.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.arcped.2021.05.006,covidwho-1275144,1769-664X,,Arch. pediatr,en,FR,2021.0,Arch Pediatr;2021 Jun 09. ,Impact and projections of the COVID-19 epidemic on attendance and routine vaccinations at a pediatric referral hospital in Cameroon.,article,,,

METHODS: We evaluated adverse events (AE) after messenger RNA vaccination in 246 adults with IBD participating in a longitudinal vaccine registry. RESULTS: In general, AE frequency was similar to that reported in the general population. AEs were more common among younger patients and those with previous COVID-19. AEs were less common in individuals receiving advanced therapies with biologics or small-molecule inhibitors.

"To access temporal changes in psychobehavioral responses to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, we conducted a 5-round (R1-R5) longitudinal population-based online survey in Hong Kong during January-September 2020. Most respondents reported wearing masks (R1 99.0% to R5 99.8%) and performing hand hygiene (R1 95.8% to R5 97.7%). Perceived COVID-19 severity decreased significantly, from 97.4% (R1) to 77.2% (R5), but perceived self-susceptibility remained high (87.2%-92.8%). Female sex and anxiety were associated with greater adoption of social distancing. Intention to receive COVID-19 vaccines decreased significantly (R4 48.7% to R5 37.6%). Greater anxiety, confidence in vaccine, and collective responsibility and weaker complacency were associated with higher tendency to receive COVID-19 vaccines. Although its generalizability should be assumed with caution, this study helps to formulate health communication strategies and foretells the initial low uptake rate of COVID-19 vaccines, suggesting that social distancing should be maintained in the medium term.","Kwok, Kin On; Li, Kin Kit; Tang, Arthur; Tsoi, Margaret Ting Fong; Chan, Emily Ying Yang; Tang, Julian Wei Tze; Wong, Angel; Wei, Wan In; Wong, Samuel Yeung Shan",,MEDLINE,COVID-19; Vaccines; COVID-19 Vaccines; Female; Hong Kong/epidemiology; Humans; Pandemics/prevention &amp;amp; control; SARS-CoV-2,20210624.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2707.210054,covidwho-1278360,1080-6059,7,Emerg Infect Dis,en,US,2021.0,"Emerg Infect Dis;27(7): 1802-1810, 2021 07.

"BACKGROUND: The main purpose in this study carried out from the perspective of infodemic was to investigate the relationships between individuals&#039; perceived causes of COVID-19, their attitudes towards vaccine and their levels of trust in information sources in terms of various descriptive characteristics. METHODS: In this cross-sectional and correlational study conducted with 1216 individuals from different provinces of Turkey, the Perception of Causes of COVID-19 (PCa-COVID-19) Scale was used. In addition, a questionnaire including the participants&#039; descriptive characteristics, their attitudes towards vaccine and their level of trust in information sources about Covid-19 was used. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 35.9 ¡À 12.3 years. Of them, 62.5% were women, 59.0% were married, and 62.1% were university graduates. As for their view of having the Covid-19 vaccine, 54.1% thought to have it, 16.2% did not think, and 29.7% were undecided. Although the correlation was not significant, of the participants, those who considered having vaccination mostly trusted YouTube as their source of information. Of the participants, those whose level of trust in government institutions and health professionals was high displayed significantly more favorable attitudes towards vaccine. The participants obtained the highest mean score from the Conspiracy Theories subscale of the PCa-COVID-19 scale. There was a positive and low-level relationship between attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccine, and the Conspiracy Theories (r: 0.214) and Faith Factors (r: 0.066) sub-dimensions of the PCa-COVID-19 Scale. CONCLUSIONS: The level of vaccine hesitancy in Turkey is at an alarming level, and the virus is defined by moderate conspiracy theories.

"BACKGROUND: Many efforts are being made around the world to discover the vaccine against COVID-19. After discovering the vaccine, its acceptance by individuals is a fundamental issue for disease control. This study aimed to examine COVID-19 vaccination intention determinants based on the protection motivation theory (PMT). METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in the Iranian adult population and surveyed 256 study participants from the first to the 30th of June 2020 with a web-based self-administered questionnaire. We used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to investigate the interrelationship between COVID-19 vaccination intention and perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived self-efficacy, and perceived response efficacy. RESULTS: SEM showed that perceived severity to COVID-19 (? = .17, p &lt; .001), perceived self-efficacy about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (? = .26, p &lt; .001), and the perceived response efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine (? = .70, p &lt; .001) were significant predictors of vaccination intention. PMT accounted for 61.5% of the variance in intention to COVID-19 vaccination, and perceived?response efficacy was the strongest predictor of COVID-19 vaccination intention. CONCLUSIONS: This study found the PMT constructs are useful in predicting COVID-19 vaccination intention. Programs designed to increase the vaccination rate after discovering the COVID-19 vaccine can include interventions on the severity of the COVID-19, the self-efficacy of individuals receiving the vaccine, and the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing infection.","Ansari-Moghaddam, Alireza; Seraji, Maryam; Sharafi, Zahra; Mohammadi, Mahdi; Okati-Aliabad, Hassan",,MEDLINE,COVID-19 Vaccines; COVID-19; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Intention; Iran; Latent Class Analysis; Motivation; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination,20210624.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11134-8,covidwho-1277924,1471-2458,1,BMC Public Health,en,GB,2021.0,"BMC Public Health;21(1): 1165, 2021 06 17.

By using lottery method, five kebeles were selected from two woredas. Systematic sampling technique was used for sampling. The total sample size was 372. It was calculated by the proportionate allocation method. Questioners were used to collect data by the observation of vaccination caring and mother interviewing. Data were entered into SPSS and analyzed. Multivariance analysis was used by considering a 95% confidence interval. Variables whose p-value less than 0.05 were identified as significant. RESULTS: The respondent rate of this study was 372 (100%). Of the total respondents, 338 (90.8%) were females and 34 (9.1%) of them were males. The coverage of full, partial, and non-vaccination is 71.77%, 16.67%, and 11.56%, respectively. Based on multivariate logistic regression analysis, child age [AOR=2.7, 95% CI: (1.36, 5.4)], no antenatal care visit [AOR=0.41, 95% CI: (0.24, 0.71)] and fear of covid 19 at health institutions [AOR=3.5, 95% CI: (2, 6)] were identified as significant variables. There are major identified factors for partial and non-vaccination. CONCLUSION: Coverage of full, partial, and non-vaccination was 71.77%, 16.67%, and 11.56%, respectively. Child age, no antenatal care visit, and fear of covid 19 at health institutions were significant variables. Fear of covid-19 is the commonest factor for partial and non-vaccination.","Jimma, M.

"Background: COVID-19 vaccination is a safe and effective approach to control the pandemic and to prevent its associated morbidity and mortality. To our knowledge, there is no study conducted to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among pregnant women in Ethiopia. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and its associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care clinic in Southwest Ethiopia. Methods: An institution-based cross-sectional study was employed from January 1 up to 30, 2021. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select 396 study participants. A structured and face-to-face interview was used to collect data. Data were entered into Epi-data version 4.2.0 and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. P values &amp;lt;0.05 result were considered as a statistically significant association. Results: The COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was found to be 70.7% (95% CI, 66.7%¨C 74.7%). Maternal age (34¨C41) years [AOR=1.464, (95% CI;1.218¨C5.129)], primary maternal educational status [AOR=3.476, (95% CI;1.520¨C7.947), good knowledge [AOR=5.946, (95% CI;3.147¨C7.065)], and good practice [AOR =9.15, (95% CI;8.734¨C12.189)] of pregnant women towards COVID-19 and its preventive measures were factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was found to be 70.9%. Maternal age (34¨C41) years, primary maternal educational status, good knowledge, and good practice of pregnant women towards COVID-19 and its preventive measures were factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Health care workers should provide health education to pregnant women to increase their knowledge about the diseases and disseminate leaflets regarding COVID-19 preventive measures. Moreover, before initiation of COVID-19 vaccine administration to pregnant women they must promote the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine.","Mose, A.; Yeshaneh, A.",,EMBASE,,20210624.0,https://doi.org/10.2147/IJGM.S314346,covidwho-1278259,,,International Journal of General Medicine,en,,2021.0,"International Journal of General Medicine; 14:2385-2395, 2021.",COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and its associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care clinic in southwest ethiopia: Institutional-based cross-sectional study,article,,,14
"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic started in December 2019 and still is a major global health challenge. Lockdown measures and social distancing sparked a global shift towards online learning, which deeply impacted universities&#039; daily life, and the University of Barcelona (UB) was not an exception. Accordingly, we aimed to determine the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic at the UB. To that end, we performed a cross-sectional study on a sample of 2784 UB members (n = 52,529). Participants answered a brief, ad hoc, online epidemiological questionnaire and provided a nasal swab for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 analysis and a venous blood sample for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody assay. Total prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive RT-PCR or positive IgG) was 14.9% (95%CI 13.3 to 17.0%). Forty-four participants (1.6%, 95%CI: 1.2-2.1%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. IgG against SARS-CoV-2 was observed in 12.8% (95%CI: 11.6-14.1%) of participants.

"In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, maintenance of protective behavior is a continued challenge in the effort to contain the spread of the virus. A cross-sectional study via an internet questionnaire was utilized to elucidate changes in compliance to protective behavior among the Israeli population (n = 1120), after the beginning of the vaccination campaign. Comparison was made between individuals who were previously infected with the virus, those who received one dose of inoculation with the vaccine, and individuals that were neither infected or vaccinated. The study results indicate that those who were previously infected with the COVID-19 virus were less careful about mask wearing (18.8%) and social distancing (29.7%), as compared to the other examined groups (regarding mask wearing, 8.2% and 11.6% respectively, and with regard to social distancing 12.8% and 19.2%), and may require targeted risk communication campaigns to address this population. Furthermore, the study revealed that those that were non-Jewish (as compared to Jewish study counterparts) or that were older (19+) were more vigilant in their protective behavior (29.6% vs. 11.2% respectively for social distancing and 29.6% vs. 11.1% respectively for mask wearing). Despite a successful initial vaccination campaign in Israel, public health officials need to engage all members of the public to unremittingly observe compliance to directed health guidelines, to ensure that the results of previous governmental efforts in fighting the pandemic (such as lockdowns) will be effectively sustained, and the road to containment will be hastened.","Kaim, Arielle; Siman-Tov, Maya; Jaffe, Eli; Adini, Bruria",,MEDLINE,,20210622.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18126503,covidwho-1273431,1660-4601,12,Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),en,CH,2021.0,Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(12)2021 Jun 16. ,From Isolation to Containment: Perceived Fear of Infectivity and Protective Behavioral Changes during the COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign.,article,,,18
"BACKGROUND: As policy makers continue to shape the national and local responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, the information they choose to share and how they frame their content provide key insights into the public and health care systems. OBJECTIVE: We examined the language used by the members of the US House and Senate during the first 10 months of the COVID-19 pandemic and measured content and sentiment based on the tweets that they shared. METHODS: We used Quorum (Quorum Analytics Inc) to access more than 300,000 tweets posted by US legislators from January 1 to October 10, 2020. We used differential language analyses to compare the content and sentiment of tweets posted by legislators based on their party affiliation. RESULTS: We found that health care-related themes in Democratic legislators&#039; tweets focused on racial disparities in care (odds ratio [OR] 2.24, 95% CI 2.22-2.27; P&lt;.001), health care and insurance (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.7-1.77; P&lt;.001), COVID-19 testing (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.12-1.19; P&lt;.001), and public health guidelines (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.22-1.29; P&lt;.001). The dominant themes in the Republican legislators&#039; discourse included vaccine development (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.47-1.55; P&lt;.001) and hospital resources and equipment (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.18-1.25). Nonhealth care-related topics associated with a Democratic affiliation included protections for essential workers (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.52-1.59), the 2020 election and voting (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.27-1.35), unemployment and housing (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.24-1.31), crime and racism (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.18-1.26), public town halls (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.16-1.23), the Trump Administration (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.19-1.26), immigration (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.12-1.19), and the loss of life (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.35-1.42). The themes associated with the Republican affiliation included China (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.85-1.92), small business assistance (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.23-1.3), congressional relief bills (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.2-1.27), press briefings (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.19-1.26), and economic recovery (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.16-1.23).

"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the attitudes of healthcare professionals toward the COVID -19 vaccine, which has been introduced to healthcare professionals at the beginning of 2021 and give information to them on the disease and vaccine. This cross-sectional analytical study has been performed by conducting an online survey to the healthcare professionals who work at the healthcare institutions in the province of Samsun in Turkey between December 2020 and January 2021. In addition to sixteen questions about the demographic characteristics, the &quot;Attitudes towards the COVID -19 vaccine&quot; scale has been used. MANOVA test and Spearman rho correlation coefficient were used in analytical examinations. A total of 1426 healthcare professional have been reached. 64.3% of participants were female, 44.1% were nurse/midwife and 66.6% were public employees. Regarding the questions in the sub-dimension of positive attitude, the rate of response of &quot;I agree/I strongly agree&quot; was between 40.6% and 54.6%. Positive attitude mean values differ according to gender, age, institution, presence of children, smoking status, being a relative who died due to COVID -19, and profession (respectively p &lt;?.001, p &lt;?.001, p &lt;?.001, p &lt;?.001, p =?.002, p =?.019, p &lt;?.001). It has been observed that positive and negative attitudes toward COVID -19 vaccination are almost equally distributed and some demographic factors affect the attitude.

"This study investigated parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for children under the age of 18?years among Chinese parents who are healthcare workers. A closed online survey among full-time doctors or nurses employed by the five collaborative hospitals who had access to smartphones was conducted. Facilitated by the hospital administrators, prospective participants received an invitation sent by the research team via the existing WeChat/QQ groups to complete an online questionnaire. A total of 2,281 participants completed the survey. This study was a sub-analysis of 1332 participants who had at least one child under the age of 18?years. Among the participants, 44.5% reported that they would likely or very likely to have their children under the age of 18?years take up COVID-19 vaccination in the next six months. After adjusting for significant background characteristics, perceived higher vaccine efficacy, longer protection duration, perceived high/very high chance for China to prevent another wave of COVID-19 outbreak with vaccines in place and willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccination for themselves were associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. At interpersonal level, higher frequency of information exposure through social media and direct interpersonal communication were associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination, while knowing some people who experienced serious side effects following COVID-19 vaccination were associated with lower parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. Despite their important roles in vaccination promotion, Chinese doctors and nurses showed low parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. Effective health promotion is needed when COVID-19 vaccination become available.","Wang, Zixin; She, Rui; Chen, Xi; Li, Liping; Li, Lijuan; Huang, Zepeng; Lau, Joseph T F",,MEDLINE,,20210622.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1917232,covidwho-1272939,2164-554X,,Hum Vaccin Immunother,en,US,2021.0,"Hum Vaccin Immunother;: 1-11, 2021 Jun 17.

"BACKGROUND: Antibodies play an important role in neutralizing invading pathogens and protecting the host against re-infection. Thus, the accurate assessment of antibodies during a pandemic can provide important evidence for monitoring pathogen exposure, understanding the role of antibodies in protective immunity, and helping vaccine development. METHODS: In this study, 96 west Iranian recovered COVID-19 subjects were recruited and, based on clinical symptoms and disease severity, categorized into three different groups: mild, moderate, and severe. In addition, the presence and dynamic change of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody three, four-, and six months post symptom onset (PSO) were measured. Also, the association between IgG antibody titer with clinical symptoms and disease severity was examined. RESULTS: Although in real-time RT-PCR-positive samples negative IgG antibody results were found, most subjects mount humoral immune responses that could raise a robust SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody. Furthermore, this antibody persisted in the serum of most recovered COVID-19 subjects at least six months PSO and demonstrated little to no decrease. Also, specific IgG antibody titer was strongly correlated with clinical symptoms and disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide an insight into the presence and persistence of the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody. Although serological tests could not be used as the primary diagnostic test, they may support real-time RT-PCR results. Also, they could be used for diagnosing COVID-19 subjects tested later outside of the optimal period. Thus, the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody is an excellent marker of COVID-19 infection or vaccination and provides an additional diagnostic tool for verifying results and helps monitor and control COVID-19 spread.","Moradi, Ghobad; Mohamadi Bolbanabad, Amjad; Ahmadi, Sanaz; Aghaei, Abbas; Bahrami, Fares; Veysi, Arshad; Nasiri Kalmarzi, Rasool; Shokri, Azad; Ghaderi, Ebrahim; Mohsenpour, Behzad; Mohammadi, Asadollah",,MEDLINE,,20210622.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2021.107893,covidwho-1272489,1878-1705,,Int Immunopharmacol,en,NL,2021.0,"Int Immunopharmacol;98: 107893, 2021 Jun 16.

"Background: Public health officials anticipate severe health outcomes amidst the circulation of two major viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza. This study investigated intent to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and influenza, and sought to identify attitudes towards vaccines and barriers for vaccine acceptance. Methods: This observational cross-sectional study was conducted in the Louisiana State University Medicine Clinic from September 2020 to December 2020. Intent to be vaccinated against the COVID-19 and influenza virus was assessed through a brief questionnaire. Additionally, hesitancy and attitudes regarding vaccines were ascertained using validated 5-point Likert scales. In total, 280 patients completed the questionnaire. Results: A total of 248 patients were included in the final analysis. Overall 167 (67%, 95% CI = 61.1-73.0%) of patients were unsure or did not intend to be vaccinated against COVID-19, while only 19.3% (95% CI = 14.4-24.5%) were unsure or did not intend to be vaccinated against the influenza vaccine. Reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy included concern regarding side effects, fear of getting sick from the vaccine, and the absence of vaccine recommendations from their doctor. Concerningly, African American patients demonstrated decreased likelihood of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion: This survey revealed that only 1 in 3 adults intended to be vaccinated against COVID-19, while 8 out of 10 adults intended to receive the influenza vaccine. Patients who intended on getting the COVID-19 vaccine were less likely to be African American. Given the degree of hesitancy against COVID-19 vaccination, a multifaceted approach to facilitate vaccine uptake that includes vaccine education, behavioral change strategies, and health promotion, is paramount.","Johnson, K.

"Background: Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca are recently introduced vaccines to combat COVID-19 pandemic. During clinical trials, mild to moderate side effects have been associated with these vaccines. Thus, we aimed to evaluate short-term post-vaccination side effects. Methods: Cross-sectional, retrospective study using an online questionnaire was conducted among COVID-19 vaccines recipients in Saudi Arabia. General and demographic data were collected, and vaccine-associated side effects after receiving at least one dose of each vaccine were evaluated. Results: Our final sample consisted of 515 participants with a median age of 26 years. Most of the study participants were female (57%). Nearly 13% of the study subjects have reported previous infections with SARS-CoV-2. Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines have been received by 75% and 25% of the study participants, respectively. Side effects associated with COVID-19 vaccines have been reported by 60% of the study subjects, and most of them reported fatigue (90%), pain at the site of the injections (85%). Conclusion: Side effects that are reported post Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines among our study participants are not different from those that were reported in the clinical trials, indicating safe profiles for both vaccines.

"Recent reports of thrombosis following AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in young females (&amp;lt;55 years-old) led to temporary suspension and urgent investigation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) that concluded that vaccine benefits still outweigh its side effects (SEs). Therefore, this study aims to provide early independent evidence on the vaccine SEs¡¯ prevalence and their potential risk factors;a cross-sectional survey-based study was carried out between February and March 2021 in Germany and Czech Republic among healthcare workers who recently received the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. The study used a validated self-administered questionnaire composed of twenty-eight multiple-choice items covering demographic variables, medical anamneses, and local, systemic, oral, and skin related SEs of the vaccine. Out of the ninety-two included participants, 77.2% were females and 79.3% were from Germany. Their mean age was 35.37 ¡À 12.62 (19¨C64) years-old, 15.2% had chronic illnesses and 22.8% were receiving medical treatments. Overall, 94.6% of the participants reported at least one SE.

The vast majority (91.9%) resolved within 1¨C3 days, and the below 35 years-old group was the least affected age group. The SEs¡¯ frequency was insignificantly higher in females and previously infected participants;the vaccine safety for the elderly was supported by the early findings of this study. Chronic illnesses and medical treatments were not associated with an increased risk of SE incidence and frequency. No blood disorder SEs were reported in our sample. Further independent studies are highly required to evaluate the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine and to explore whether gender or previous infection could be associated with the vaccine SEs.","Riad, Abanoub, Pokorn¨¢, Andrea, Mekhemar, Mohamed, Conrad, Jonas, Klugarov¨¢, Jitka, Ko??¨ªk, Michal, Klugar, Miloslav, Attia, Sameh",,MDPI,,20210622.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9060673,covidwho-1273530,,6,Vaccines,en,,2021.0,"Vaccines; 9(6):673, 2021.",Safety of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Vaccine: Independent Evidence from Two EU States,article,,,9
"Background: This study assesses the perceptions and acceptance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination. It also examines its influencing factors among the healthcare workers (HCWs) in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Methods: In this cross-sectional study performed in November and December 2020, a total of 1308 HCWs from two large academic hospitals participated in the Eastern Cape Healthcare Workers Acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 (ECHAS) study. Validated measures of vaccine hesitancy were explored using a questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to identify the determinants of vaccine hesitancy. Results: The majority were nurses (45.2%), and at risk for unfavourable Covid-19 outcome, due to obesity (62.9%) and having direct contact with individuals confirmed to have Covid-19 (77.1%). The overall acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was 90.1%, which differed significantly by level of education. Individuals with lower educational attainment (primary and secondary education) and those with prior vaccine refusal were less likely to accept the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. However, positive perceptions about the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were independently associated with vaccine acceptance. Conclusions: The high level of acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is reassuring;however, HCWs with a lower level of education and those with prior vaccine refusal should be targeted for further engagements to address their concerns and fears.","Adeniyi, Oladele Vincent, Stead, David, Singata-Madliki, Mandisa, Batting, Joanne, Wright, Matthew, Jelliman, Eloise, Abrahams, Shareef, Parrish, Andrew",,MDPI,,20210622.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9060666,covidwho-1273528,,6,Vaccines,en,,2021.0,"Vaccines; 9(6):666, 2021.","Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccine among the Healthcare Workers in the Eastern Cape, South Africa: A Cross Sectional Study",article,,,9
"Even though vaccination programs have now started in earnest across the globe and in Qatar, vaccine hesitancy remains a barrier to effectively tackling the pandemic. Many factors influence willingness to take vaccines including safety, efficacy, and side effects. Given their proximity to research and education, university students and employees represent an interesting cohort in which to investigate vaccine hesitancy. The aim of this study was to assess the attitudes of Qatar University employees and students towards the COVID-19 vaccine. In total, 231 employees and 231 students participated in an online cross-sectional study in February 2021. Of the sample, 62.6% were willing to take a vaccine against COVID-19. Participants with or taking postgraduate degrees were more willing to take the vaccine compared to participants with or taking a diploma or bachelor¡¯s degree (p &amp;lt;0.001). Males had a higher rate of vaccine acceptance (p &amp;lt;0.001). In the group that regarded flu vaccination as important, 13% were unwilling to take COVID-19 vaccine. There were no associations between willingness to vaccinate and vaccine/virus knowledge and social media use. Participants showed a high level of concern regarding vaccine side effects in themselves or their children. Two-thirds agreed or strongly agreed that they would take the vaccine if it was mandatory for international travel. Our participants were neutral to the origin of vaccine development. These findings, which represent data collected after the start of the national vaccination program, show that vaccine hesitancy persists in the Qatari population and that some groups, such as undergraduate students, could benefit from specific, targeted public health campaigns.","Al-Mulla, Reem, Abu-Madi, Marawan, Talafha, Qusai M.; Tayyem, Reema F.; Abdallah, Atiyeh M.",,MDPI,,20210622.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9060665,covidwho-1273527,,6,Vaccines,en,,2021.0,"Vaccines; 9(6):665, 2021.",COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy in a Representative Education Sector Population in Qatar,article,,,9
"The vaccine confidence index in Japan is one of the lowest worldwide. This study aimed to examine the proportion of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the Japanese population using a larger sample and more robust statistical methods than previously, and to identify factors associated with vaccine hesitancy. We conducted a nationwide, cross-sectional Internet survey on 8¨C26 February 2021, and calculated the proportion and odds ratios for vaccine hesitancy. Among 23,142 responses analyzed, the proportion of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was 11.3% (10.9¨C11.7%). The proportion was higher among younger respondents and female respondents, and especially among younger female respondents (15.6%) compared with the lowest proportion among older male respondents (4.8%). The most cited reason for not getting vaccinated was concerns about adverse reactions in more than 70% of the respondents. The proportion of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Japan was comparable to that in previous studies overseas, and the proportion among younger respondents was more than double that among older respondents. Factors associated with the hesitancy were female sex, living alone, low socioeconomic status, and presence of severe psychological distress, especially among older respondents. Thus, adequate measures should be taken to ensure that vaccines are delivered to people with these factors.","Okubo, Ryo, Yoshioka, Takashi, Ohfuji, Satoko, Matsuo, Takahiro, Tabuchi, Takahiro",,MDPI,,20210622.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9060662,covidwho-1273525,,6,Vaccines,en,,2021.0,"Vaccines; 9(6):662, 2021.",COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy and Its Associated Factors in Japan,article,,,9
"The success of large-scale COVID-19 vaccination campaigns is contingent upon people being willing to receive the vaccine. Our study explored COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its correlates in eight different countries around the globe. We analyzed convenience sample data collected between March 2020 and January 2021 as part of the iCARE cross-sectional study. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were conducted to explore the correlates of vaccine hesitancy. We included 32,028 participants from eight countries, and observed that 27% of the participants exhibited vaccine hesitancy, with increases over time. France reported the highest level of hesitancy (47.3%) and Brazil reported the lowest (9.6%). Women, younger individuals (¡Ü29 years), people living in rural areas, and those with a lower perceived income were more likely to be hesitant. People who previously received an influenza vaccine were 70% less likely to report COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. We observed that people reporting greater COVID-19 health concerns were less likely to be hesitant, whereas people with higher personal financial concerns were more likely to be hesitant. Our findings indicate that there is substantial vaccine hesitancy in several countries, with cross-national differences in the magnitude and direction of the trend. Vaccination communication initiatives should target hesitant individuals (women, younger adults, people with lower incomes and those living in rural areas), and should highlight the immediate health, social and economic benefits of vaccination across these settings. Country-level analyses are warranted to understand the complex psychological, socio-environmental, and cultural factors associated with vaccine hesitancy.","Stojanovic, Jovana, Boucher, Vincent G.; Gagne, Myriam, Gupta, Samir, Joyal-Desmarais, Keven, Paduano, Stefania, Aburub, Ala¡¯ S.; Sheinfeld Gorin, Sherri N.; Kassianos, Angelos P.; Ribeiro, Paula A.

"Background: With the continuous large-scale development of the COVID-19 vaccine, the acceptance of vaccination and its influencing factors at the individual level have become crucial to stemming the pandemic. This study aims to explore the factors that influence the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among international college students. Methods: The target population constituted international students pursuing various degrees in Jiangsu Province through an online cross-sectional study. A cluster random sampling was performed using a self-administered questionnaire. The Health Belief Model and Knowledge, Attitude/Beliefs, and Practice Theory served as the underlying theories to understanding the factors that influence vaccine acceptance. Results: We received 330 responses. About 36.4% intended to accept the vaccine. The acceptance varied across respondents¡¯ place of residence, program of study, continent of origin, knowledge, susceptibility, severity, benefits, and cues to action (p &amp;lt; 0.05). A multivariable logistics regression revealed cues to action (p &amp;lt; 0.001), the perception of COVID-19 vaccination benefits (p = 0.002), and the perception of barriers (p &amp;lt; 0.001) that were associated with vaccine acceptance. Conclusions: The acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine was low among international students. The correct and comprehensive beliefs of the target groups regarding the benefits and barriers of the vaccination must be raised. Various effective social strategies must be adopted to trigger the intention of COVID-19 vaccination. The study findings will inform the decisions of public health campaigners, aimed at reducing vaccine hesitation when the COVID-19 vaccine is widely available.","Walker, A. N.; Zhang, T.; Peng, X.

"Background: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is a serious threat to mass vaccination strategies that need to be accelerated currently in order to achieve a substantial level of community immunity. Independent (non-sponsored) studies have a great potential to enhance public confidence in vaccines and accelerate their uptake process. Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional study for the side effects (SE) of CoronaVac was carried out in February 2021 among Turkish healthcare workers who were recently vaccinated. The questionnaire inquired about local and systemic SEs that occurred in the short-term, within four weeks, following vaccination. Results: A total of 780 healthcare workers were included in this study;62.5% of them experienced at least one SE. Injection site pain (41.5%) was the most common local SE, while fatigue (23.6%), headache (18.7%), muscle pain (11.2%) and joint pain (5.9%) were the common systemic SEs. Female healthcare workers (67.9%) were significantly more affected by local and systemic SEs than male colleagues (51.4%). Younger age, previous infection, and compromised health status (chronic illnesses and regular medicines uptake) can be associated with an increased risk of CoronaVac SEs;Conclusions: The independent research shows a higher prevalence of CoronaVac SEs than what is reported by phase I¨CIII clinical trials. In general, the results of this study confirm the overall safety of CoronaVac and suggest potential risk factors for its SEs. Gender-based differences and SEs distribution among age groups are worth further investigation.","Riad, A.; Sa??ro?lu, D.; &amp;Uuml;st¨¹n, B.; Pokorn¨¢, A.; Klugarov¨¢, J.; Attia, S.; Klugar, M.",,EMBASE,,20210622.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10122629,covidwho-1273467,,12,Journal of Clinical Medicine,en,,2021.0,"Journal of Clinical Medicine; 10(12), 2021.",Article prevalence and risk factors of coronavac side effects: An independent cross-sectional study among healthcare workers in turkey,article,,,10
"Background: The study aimed to assess the intention to accept a future COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria and associated factors. Patients &amp; Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online questionnaire between July 2020 and August 2020 that captured demographic data, risk perception;trust in government and public health authorities and willingness to accept a future COVID-19 vaccine. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science and Chi-square and logistic regression at a 95% confidence interval calculated. Appropriate institutional ethical board approval and informed consent obtained from all participants were obtained. Results: 1,228 responses were received over the study period. The mean age of respondents was 32.8 years (SD 10.4), 12.7% (156/1,228) were health workers, and 66.9% (820/1,228) had tertiary level of education. Intention to accept a future COVID-19 vaccine was expressed by 50.2% (617/1,228). Older age, male gender, trust in government, trust in public health authorities, confidence in vaccine developers, willingness to pay for and travel for a vaccine, and vaccination during an outbreak were significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Healthcare workers and respondents with pre-existing medical conditions were not significantly different from non-healthcare workers and persons without medical conditions respectively with regards to the willingness to be vaccinated. Conclusion: One in 2 persons would accept a COVID-19 vaccine when one becomes available in the country. The government should take pro-active steps to address the factors that may potentially impact on the benefits expected from the introduction of a COVID-19 vaccine in the country.","Tobin, E.

"Innate immunity triggers responsible for viral control or hyperinflammation in COVID-19 are largely unknown. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-protein) primes inflammasome formation and release of mature interleukin-1? (IL-1?) in macrophages derived from COVID-19 patients but not in macrophages from healthy SARS-CoV-2 na?ve individuals. Furthermore, longitudinal analyses reveal robust S-protein-driven inflammasome activation in macrophages isolated from convalescent COVID-19 patients, which correlates with distinct epigenetic and gene expression signatures suggesting innate immune memory after recovery from COVID-19. Importantly, we show that S-protein-driven IL-1? secretion from patient-derived macrophages requires non-specific monocyte pre-activation in vivo to trigger NLRP3-inflammasome signaling. Our findings reveal that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes profound and long-lived reprogramming of macrophages resulting in augmented immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, a major vaccine antigen and potent driver of adaptive and innate immune signaling.","Theobald, Sebastian J; Simonis, Alexander; Georgomanolis, Theodoros; Kreer, Christoph; Zehner, Matthias; Eisfeld, Hannah S; Albert, Marie-Christine; Chhen, Jason; Motameny, Susanne; Erger, Florian; Fischer, Julia; Malin, Jakob J; Gr?b, Jessica; Winter, Sandra; Pouikli, Andromachi; David, Friederike; B?ll, Boris; Koehler, Philipp; Vanshylla, Kanika; Gruell, Henning; Su¨¢rez, Isabelle; Hallek, Michael; F?tkenheuer, Gerd; Jung, Norma; Cornely, Oliver A; Lehmann, Clara; Tessarz, Peter; Altm¨¹ller, Janine; N¨¹rnberg, Peter; Kashkar, Hamid; Klein, Florian; Koch, Manuel; Rybniker, Jan",,MEDLINE,,20210618.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.15252/emmm.202114150,covidwho-1271067,1757-4684,,EMBO Mol Med,en,GB,2021.0,"EMBO Mol Med;: e14150, 2021 Jun 16.

"OBJECTIVE: A key challenge towards a successful COVID-19 vaccine uptake is vaccine hesitancy. We examine and provide novel insights on the key drivers and barriers towards COVID-19 vaccine uptake. DESIGN: This study involved an anonymous cross-sectional online survey circulated across the UK in September 2020. The survey was designed to include several sections to collect demographic data and responses on (1) extent of agreement regarding various statements about COVID-19 and vaccinations, (2) previous vaccination habits (eg, if they had previously declined vaccination) and (3) interest in participation in vaccine trials. Multinominal logistic models examined demographic factors that may impact vaccine uptake. We used principle component analysis and text mining to explore perception related to vaccine uptake. SETTING: The survey was circulated through various media, including posts on social media networks (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram), national radio, news articles, Clinical Research Network website and newsletter, and through 150 West Midlands general practices via a text messaging service. PARTICIPANTS: There were a total of 4884 respondents of which 9.44% were black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) group. The majority were women (n=3416, 69.9%) and of white ethnicity (n=4127, 84.5%). RESULTS: Regarding respondents, overall, 3873 (79.3%) were interested in taking approved COVID-19 vaccines, while 677 (13.9%) were unsure, and 334 (6.8%) would not take a vaccine. Participants aged over 70 years old (OR=4.63) and the BAME community (OR=5.48) were more likely to take an approved vaccine. Smokers (OR=0.45) and respondents with no known illness (OR=0.70) were less likely to accept approved vaccines. The study identified 16 key reasons for not accepting approved vaccines, the most common (60%) being the possibility of the COVID-19 vaccine having side effects. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an insight into focusing on specific populations to reduce vaccine hesitancy. This proves crucial in managing the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sethi, Sonika; Kumar, Aditi; Mandal, Anandadeep; Shaikh, Mohammed; Hall, Claire A; Kirk, Jeremy M W; Moss, Paul; Brookes, Matthew J; Basu, Supratik",,MEDLINE,COVID-19; Vaccines; Aged; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; United Kingdom; Vaccination,20210618.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-048856,covidwho-1270894,2044-6055,6,BMJ Open,en,GB,2021.0,"BMJ Open;11(6): e048856, 2021 06 15.

"The approved Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines are well known to induce serum antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)-protein. However, their abilities to elicit mucosal immune responses have not been reported. Saliva antibodies represent mucosal responses that may be relevant to how mRNA vaccines prevent oral and nasal SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here, we describe the outcome of a cross-sectional study on a healthcare worker cohort (WEL-COME-NYPH), in which we assessed whether IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies to the S-protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) were present in serum and saliva samples. Anti-S-protein IgG was detected in 14/31 and 66/66 of saliva samples from uninfected participants after vaccine dos-es-1 and-2, respectively. IgA antibodies to the S-protein were present in 40/66 saliva samples after dose 2. Anti-S-protein IgG was present in every serum sample from recipients of 2 vaccine doses. Vaccine-induced antibodies against the RBD were also frequently present in saliva and sera. These findings may help our understanding of whether and how vaccines may impede SARS-CoV-2 transmission, including to oral cavity target cells. ? 2021 Pathogens and Immunity.","Ketas, T.

"BACKGROUND: To report the baseline phase of the SIEROEPID study on SARS-CoV-2 infection seroprevalence among health workers at the University Hospital of Verona, Italy, between spring and fall 2020; to compare performances of several laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection. METHODS: 5299 voluntary health workers were enrolled from 28 April 2020 to 28 July 2020 to assess immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout IgM, IgG and IgA serum levels titration by four laboratory tests. Association of antibody titre with several demographic variables, swab tests and performance tests (sensitivity, specificity, and agreement) were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence was 6%, considering either IgG and IgM, and 4.8% considering IgG. Working in COVID-19 Units was not associated with a statistically significant increase in the number of infected workers. Cohen&#039;s kappa of agreement between MaglumiTM and VivaDiagTM was quite good when considering IgG only (Cohen&#039;s kappa = 78.1%, 95% CI 74.0-82.0%), but was lower considering IgM (Cohen&#039;s kappa = 13.3%, 95% CI 7.8-18.7%). CONCLUSION: The large sample size with high participation (84.7%), the biobank and the longitudinal design were significant achievements, offering a baseline dataset as the benchmark for risk assessment, health surveillance and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection for the hospital workforce, especially considering the ongoing vaccination campaign. Study results support the national regulator guidelines on using swabs for SARS-CoV-2 screening with health workers and using the serological tests to contribute to the epidemiological assessment of the spread of the virus.","Porru, Stefano; Monaco, Maria Grazia Lourdes; Carta, Angela; Spiteri, Gianluca; Parpaiola, Marco; Battaggia, Andrea; Galligioni, Giulia; Ferrazzi, Beatrice; Lo Cascio, Giuliana; Gibellini, Davide; Peretti, Angelo; Brutti, Martina; Tardivo, Stefano; Ghirlanda, Giovanna; Verlato, Giuseppe; Gaino, Stefania; Peserico, Denise; Bassi, Antonella; Lippi, Giuseppe",,MEDLINE,,20210617.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18126446,covidwho-1270056,1660-4601,12,Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),en,CH,2021.0,Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(12)2021 Jun 14. ,SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Health Workers: Analysis from Verona SIEROEPID Study during the Pre-Vaccination Era.,article,,,18
"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 disease is a pandemic threat for humanity&#039;s healthcare system, social, economic, and psychological well-being for both developed and developing nations. In the case of developing nations such as the resource of Ethiopia, however, the key obstacle is to buy the vaccine and administer it to their people. In the study area, however, the degree of adherence to the covid-19 preventive measure was not well established. The aim of this study is to determine adherence to covid-19 prevention measures in Hossana town. METHODS: From 3 to 29 January 2021, a community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among individuals living in the Hosanna town. We used a sample size of 384. The sample size was distributed to all 8 kebeles in proportion to the size of the households contained in each kebele in the town of Hossana. Systematic sampling methods were used and both descriptive and advanced analysis, data was entered into Epi-data and exported to SPSS. Binary logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with adherence to preventive measures for covid-19. RESULT: 50.4% of the study participants had good adherence with the COVID-19 preventive measures. 145 (38.5%) of all respondents had poor knowledge on COVID-19 preventive measures and 40.3 % had poor COVID-19 transmission methods knowledge.

"The objectives were to explore, among university students, the level of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, and resistancy and to determine the motivations and barriers, and the reasons that may change student vaccination decision making. An online observational cross-sectional study was conducted among students of a French university in January 2021 with questions about the intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19, the motivations and the barriers. The convenience sample included 3089 students, with a mean of age of 20.3 (SD = 1.9). To the question on the intention to vaccinate against the COVID-19, 58.0% of students reported that they would choose to have a vaccination, 17.0% reported that they would not and 25.0% were not sure. The main motivations for vaccine acceptance were ¡°I don¡ät want to transmit COVID-19 to others¡±, the main barriers for vaccine resistance or hesitancy were ¡°I prefer to wait until I have more experience with these new vaccines¡±. Age, female gender, being in first three years of study, studied sciences courses and neither sciences nor healthcare courses of study were significantly associated with a higher risk of vaccine hesitancy or resistancy. Self-estimated knowledge of conventional vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines, and confidence in efficiency and safety of conventional vaccination were associated with a lower risk of vaccine hesitancy or resistancy. It is relevant to disseminate evidence-based interventions to promote COVID-19 vaccine acceptability for college students, especially for the students in neither sciences nor healthcare courses of study, as college students will soon be eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.","Tavolacci, Marie Pierre, Dechelotte, Pierre, Ladner, Joel",,MDPI,,20210617.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9060654,covidwho-1270136,,6,Vaccines,en,,2021.0,"Vaccines; 9(6):654, 2021.","COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance, Hesitancy, and Resistancy among University Students in France",article,,,9
"Background: Immunization is an important strategy for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 vaccination was recently launched in Uganda, with prioritization to healthcare workers and high-risk individuals. In this study, we aimed to determine the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccine among persons at high risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in Uganda. Methods: Between 29 March and 14 April 2021, we conducted a cross-sectional survey consecutively recruiting persons at high risk of severe COVID-19 (diabetes mellitus, HIV and cardiovascular disease) attending Kiruddu National Referral Hospital outpatient clinics. A trained research nurse administered a semi-structured questionnaire assessing demographics, COVID-19 vaccine related attitudes and acceptability. Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariable analyses were performed using STATA 16. Results: A total of 317 participants with a mean age 51.5 ¡À 14.1 years were recruited. Of this, 184 (60.5%) were female. Overall, 216 (70.1%) participants were willing to accept the COVID-19 vaccine. The odds of willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccination were four times greater if a participant was male compared with if a participant was female [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 4.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.8¨C9.4, p = 0.00]. Participants who agreed (AOR: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01¨C0.38, p = 0.003) or strongly agreed (AOR: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01¨C0.59, p = 0.005) that they have some immunity against COVID-19 were also significantly less likely to accept the vaccine. Participants who had a history of vaccination hesitancy for their children were also significantly less likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccine (AOR: 0.1, 95% CI: 0.01¨C0.58, p = 0.016).

"Background: Healthcare workers&#039; (HCWs&#039;) travel-related anxiety needs to be assessed in light of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 mutations. Methods: An online, cross-sectional questionnaire among HCWs between December 21, 2020 to January 7, 2021. The outcome variables were HCWs&#039; knowledge and awareness of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage that was recently reported as the UK variant of concern, and its associated travel worry and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score. Results: A total of 1,058 HCWs completed the survey; 66.5% were female, 59.0% were nurses. 9.0% indicated they had been previously diagnosed with COVID-19. Regarding the B.1.1.7 lineage, almost all (97.3%) were aware of its emergence, 73.8% were aware that it is more infectious, 78.0% thought it causes more severe disease, and only 50.0% knew that current COVID-19 vaccines are effective in preventing it. Despite this, 66.7% of HCWs were not registered to receive the vaccine. HCWs&#039; most common source of information about the new variant was social media platforms (67.0%), and this subgroup was significantly more worried about traveling. Nurses were more worried than physicians (P = 0.001). Conclusions: Most HCWs were aware of the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant and expressed substantial travel worries. Increased worry levels were found among HCWs who used social media as their main source of information, those with lower levels of COVID-19 vaccine uptake, and those with higher GAD-7 scores. The utilization of official social media platforms could improve accurate information dissemination among HCWs regarding the Pandemic&#039;s evolving mutations. Targeted vaccine campaigns are warranted to assure HCWs about the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines toward SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Temsah, Mohamad-Hani; Barry, Mazin; Aljamaan, Fadi; Alhuzaimi, Abdullah N; Al-Eyadhy, Ayman; Saddik, Basema; Alsohime, Fahad; Alhaboob, Ali; Alhasan, Khalid; Alaraj, Ali; Halwani, Rabih; Jamal, Amr; Alamro, Nurah; Temsah, Reem; Esmaeil, Samia; Alenezi, Shuliweeh; Alzamil, Fahad; Somily, Ali M; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A",,MEDLINE,COVID-19 Vaccines; COVID-19; Anxiety; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Perception; SARS-CoV-2; Travel; Travel-Related Illness; United Kingdom,20210616.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.686958,covidwho-1268319,2296-2565,,Front Public Health,en,CH,2021.0,"Front Public Health;9: 686958, 2021.

"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown high efficacy of multiple vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19), and recent studies have shown the vaccines are also effective against infection. Evidence for the effect of each of these vaccines on ability to transmit the virus is also beginning to emerge. We describe an approach to estimate these vaccines&#039; effects on viral positivity, a prevalence measure which under the reasonable assumption that vaccinated individuals who become infected are no more infectious than unvaccinated individuals forms a lower bound on efficacy against transmission. Specifically, we recommend separate analysis of positive tests triggered by symptoms (usually the primary RCT outcome) and cross-sectional prevalence of positive tests obtained regardless of symptoms. The odds ratio of carriage for vaccine vs. placebo provides an unbiased estimate of vaccine effectiveness against viral positivity, under certain assumptions, and we show through simulations that likely departures from these assumptions will only modestly bias this estimate. Applying this approach to published data from the RCT of the Moderna vaccine, we estimate that one dose of vaccine reduces the potential for transmission by at least 61%, possibly considerably more. We describe how these approaches can be translated into observational studies of vaccine effectiveness.","Lipsitch, Marc; Kahn, Rebecca",,MEDLINE,,20210616.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.06.011,covidwho-1267951,1873-2518,30,Vaccine,en,NL,2021.0,"Vaccine;39(30): 4082-4088, 2021 Jul 05.

"OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 disproportionately impacts residents in long-term care facilities. Our objective was to quantify the presence and magnitude of antibody response in vaccinated, older adult residents at assisted living, personal care, and independent living communities. DESIGN: A cross-sectional quality improvement study was conducted March 15 - April 1, 2021 in the greater Pittsburgh region. SETTING: and Population: Participants were older adult residents at assisted living, personal care, and independent living communities, who received mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine. Conditions that impair immune responses were exclusionary criteria. METHODS: Sera were collected to measure IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody level with reflex to total anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin levels, and blinded evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization titers. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficients, and multiple linear regression analysis evaluated relationships between factors potentially associated with antibody levels. Spearman correlations were calculated between antibody levels and neutralization titers. RESULTS: All participants (N?= 70) had received two rounds of vaccination and were found to have antibodies with wide variation in relative levels. Antibody levels trended lower in males, advanced age, current use of steroids, and longer length of time from vaccination. Pseudovirus neutralization titer levels were strongly correlated (P &lt; .001) with Beckman Coulter antibody levels (D614?G NT50, rs?= 0.91; B.1.1.7 [UK] NT50, rs?= 0.91). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Higher functioning, healthier, residential older adults mounted detectable antibody responses when vaccinated with mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. Data suggests some degree of immunity is present during the immediate period following vaccination. However, protective effects remain to be determined in larger studies as clinical protection is afforded by ongoing adaptive immunity, which is known to be decreased in older adults. This study provides important preliminary results on level of population risk in older adult residents at assisted living, personal care, and independent living communities to inform reopening strategies, but are not likely to be translatable for residents in nursing homes.","Nace, David A; Kip, Kevin E; Mellors, John W; Peck Palmer, Octavia M; Shurin, Michael R; Mulvey, Katie; Crandall, Melissa; Sobolewski, Michele D; Enick, P Nathan; McCormic, Kevin D; Jacobs, Jana L; Kane, April L; Lukanski, Amy; Kip, Paula L; Wells, Alan",,MEDLINE,,20210616.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2021.06.006,covidwho-1267723,1538-9375,,J.

"Objectives Migrant workers are one of the most vulnerable population groups during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study investigated knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 among Indonesian migrant workers (IMWs) in Macao (SAR), Hong Kong (SAR) and Taiwan. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Data were collected through an online survey in February and March 2020 to gain information on: (a) participants¡¯ sociodemographic characteristics;(b) experience and awareness regarding COVID-19 information;and (c) knowledge and understanding of COVID-19. A series of Chi-square, t-test and logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results The survey was completed by 491 participants (92.1% female). Knowledge of COVID-19 was obtained from multiple sources, including a large proportion from online social media. However, participants who obtained information from their employer, local social networks and migrant organisations answered a greater number of questions correctly. One-third of participants reported receiving hoax, fake news and incorrect information, and obtained information from unverified sources. Participants were most interested in information about how to cure COVID-19 and 57.8% knew that no specific drug or vaccine was currently available. Almost all participants correctly identified fever and wearing a facemask as the main COVID-19 symptom and prevention strategy, respectively. Participants with senior high school or higher education and who worked as domestic or care workers had a greater knowledge of COVID-19 than their counterparts. Conclusions Public health communication strategies utilising multiple channels, including employers and community organisations, would help to minimise COVID-19 knowledge gaps. In addition, it is recommended that digital literacy content is added to public health campaigns.","Liem, Andrian, Wang, Cheng, Dong, Chaoran, Lam, Agnes Iok Fong, Latkin, Carl A.; Hall, Brian J.",,ScienceDirect,,20210616.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.05.029,covidwho-1267893,,,Public Health,en,,2021.0,Public Health;2021.,Knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 among Indonesian migrant workers in the Greater China Region,article,,,

"The mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs) is critical to their long-term well-being and future disaster preparedness. Goal 1 of this study was to identify rates of mental health problems experienced by HCWs. Goal 2 was to test a model of risk stemming from pandemic-related stressors and vulnerability factors. This cross-sectional study included HCWs (N = 2,246 [1,573 clinical providers;673 non-clinical staff]) in the Rocky Mountain West who voluntarily completed an online survey in April/May 2020. Respondents completed measures for traumatic stress symptoms, depression, anxiety, alcohol use, and sleep. Logistic regressions stratified by professional role (clinical versus non-clinical) were specified to predict clinical screening cutoff (positive/negative) as a function of five pandemic-related stressors (immunocompromised self;immunocompromised household member;care provision to infected patients;clinical management role;positive cases). Results showed that more than half of HCWs surveyed (52.5%) screened positive (above cutoff) for traumatic stress, depression, or anxiety, with ¡«20% reporting problematic alcohol use, and variable insufficient sleep from ¡«10% off shift to ¡«50% on shift. Clinical employees with an immunocompromised household member had increased odds of screening positive for a mental health problem. Non-clinical HCWs who were immunocompromised were at elevated risk for screening positive a mental health problem. Being female, minority status, and younger increased odds for mental health problems. Implications include alleviating a portion of the mental health burden of HCWs involved in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by considering policies to protect immunocompromised HCWs and their families (e.g., vaccine priorities, telework options).","Smith, Andrew J.; Wright, Hannah, Griffin, Brandon J.; Ehman, Anandi C.; Shoji, Kotaro, Love, Tiffany M.; Morrow, Ellen, Locke, Amy, Call, Megan, Kerig, Patricia K.; Olff, Miranda, Benight, Charles C.; Langenecker, Scott A.",,ScienceDirect,,20210616.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2021.100285,covidwho-1267606,,,"Brain, Behavior, &amp; Immunity - Health",en,,2021.0,"Brain, Behavior, &amp; Immunity - Health;: 100285, 2021.",Mental Health Risks Differentially Associated with Immunocompromised Status among Healthcare Workers and Family Members at the Pandemic Outset,article,,,
"Background There is a paucity of literature addressing COVID-19 case-fatality ratios (CFR) by zip code (ZC). We aim to analyze trends in COVID-19 CFR, population density, and socioeconomic status (SES) indicators (unemployment, median household income) to identify ZCs heavily burdened by COVID-19. Methods Cross-sectional study to investigate the US prevalence of COVD-19 fatalities by ZC and SES. CFRs were calculated from state/county Departments of Health. Inclusion criteria were counties that reported cases/deaths by ZC and a CFR¡Ý2%. This study was reported in line with the STROCSS criteria. Results 609/1,853 ZCs, spanning 327 counties in 7 states had CFRs ¡Ý2%. A significant positive correlation was found between the CFR and median household income (Pearson correlation:0.107;95% CI [289.1,1937.9];p?&amp;lt;?0.001). No significant correlations exist between the CFR, and population/mi (Sen-Crowe et al., 2020) [2] or unemployment rate. Significant associations exist between the CFR and young males and elderly females without public insurance. CFR was inversely associated with persons aged &amp;lt;44 and individuals aged ¡Ý65. The percentage of nursing homes (NHs) within cities residing within high CFR ZCs range from 8.7% to 67.6%. Conclusion Significant positive association was found between the CFR and median household income. Population/mi (Sen-Crowe et al., 2020) [2] and unemployment rates, did not correlate to CFR. NHs were heavily distributed in high CFR zip codes. We recommend the targeted vaccination of zip codes with a large proportion of long-term care facilities. Finally, we recommend for improved screening and safety guidelines for vulnerable populations (e.g nursing home residents) and established protocols for when there is evidence of substantial infectious spread.","Sen-Crowe, Brendon, Lin, I.

"BACKGROUND: The diverse Asian American population has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but due to limited data and other factors, disparities experienced by this population are hidden. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the Asian American community&#039;s experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the Greater San Francisco Bay Area, California, and to better inform a Federally Qualified Health Center&#039;s (FQHC) health care services and response to challenges faced by the community. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey between May 20 and June 23, 2020, using a multipronged recruitment approach, including word-of-mouth, FQHC patient appointments, and social media posts. The survey was self-administered online or administered over the phone by FQHC staff in English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Vietnamese. Survey question topics included COVID-19 testing and preventative behaviors, economic impacts of COVID-19, experience with perceived mistreatment due to their race/ethnicity, and mental health challenges. RESULTS: Among 1297 Asian American respondents, only 3.1% (39/1273) had previously been tested for COVID-19, and 46.6% (392/841) stated that they could not find a place to get tested. In addition, about two-thirds of respondents (477/707) reported feeling stressed, and 22.6% (160/707) reported feeling depressed. Furthermore, 5.6% (72/1275) of respondents reported being treated unfairly because of their race/ethnicity. Among respondents who experienced economic impacts from COVID-19, 32.2% (246/763) had lost their regular jobs and 22.5% (172/763) had reduced hours or reduced income. Additionally, 70.1% (890/1269) of respondents shared that they avoid leaving their home to go to public places (eg, grocery stores, church, and school). CONCLUSIONS: We found that Asian Americans had lower levels of COVID-19 testing and limited access to testing, a high prevalence of mental health issues and economic impacts, and a high prevalence of risk-avoidant behaviors (eg, not leaving the house) in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings provide preliminary insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Asian American communities served by an FQHC and underscore the longstanding need for culturally and linguistically appropriate approaches to providing mental health, outreach, and education services. These findings led to the establishment of the first Asian multilingual and multicultural COVID-19 testing sites in the local area where the study was conducted, and laid the groundwork for subsequent COVID-19 programs, specifically contact tracing and vaccination programs.","Quach, Thu; Do¨¤n, Lan N; Liou, Julia; Ponce, Ninez A",,MEDLINE,Asian Americans/psychology; COVID-19 Testing/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; COVID-19/ethnology; Healthcare Disparities/ethnology; Mental Disorders/ethnology; Pandemics; Risk Reduction Behavior; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Asian Americans/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; San Francisco/epidemiology; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult,20210615.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/23976,covidwho-1266619,2369-2960,6,JMIR Public Health Surveill,en,CA,2021.0,"JMIR Public Health Surveill;7(6): e23976, 2021 06 11.

"OBJECTIVES: In the current Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic there is still great uncertainty about the effects of an infection in pregnancy especially regarding a possible fetal transmission of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and the longevity of this immunity. METHODS: Sixteen women who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and their offspring were included. The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 was measured in mother and umbilical cord blood peripartum and in a follow-up examination 6-11?weeks after birth. Medical history, symptoms regarding SARS-CoV-2, obstetric and neonatal information were queried following recommendations by the WHO. RESULTS: A total of 73% of the women and one third of the?infants developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)?protein receptor binding domain (RBD), with a long interval between infection and birth proving favorable for a transplacentar transfer of antibodies to the neonates. All infants showed declining or vanishing antibody-titers in the follow-up examination, while the titers of their mothers were stable or even increased. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that transplacental transfer of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies is possible, but also indicate that the immunity that may be gained as a result might decrease in newborns postpartum. This provides important evidence that could be useful for further studies covering vaccination during pregnancy.","Rathberger, Katharina; H?usler, Sebastian; Wellmann, Sven; Weigl, Marco; Langhammer, Florian; Bazzano, Maria Victoria; Ambrosch, Andreas; Fill Malfertheiner, Sara",,MEDLINE,,20210615.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2021-0166,covidwho-1266566,1619-3997,,J. perinat. med,en,DE,2021.0,J Perinat Med;2021 Jun 11. ,SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy and possible transfer of immunity: assessment of peripartal maternal and neonatal antibody levels and a longitudinal follow-up.,article,,,
"BACKGROUND: Health experts agree that widespread use of safe and effective vaccines will rapidly contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The big question is whether these vaccines can easily be accepted by their end-users. Our study aimed at determining sociodemographic factors associated with acceptance of vaccines and clinical trials of COVID-19 in western Uganda. METHOD: A simplified snowball sampling technique was used to select 1067 respondents of 18-70 years in western Uganda using an online questionnaire from July to September 2020. Vaccine acceptability and risk perception were assessed using odds ratio at 95% confidence interval in R software version 3.6.3. RESULTS: There were 1067 participants in the study. The majority were males (73.2%) and age group 31-40 years (32.6%). The acceptance rate for COVID-19 vaccination was (53.6%; 572/1067) with those aged 18-20 years, males, elites at tertiary level of education (degree or diploma), students, Muslims, married, non-salary earners and rural dwellers having better odds and likeliness to accept vaccination. Only 44.6% (476/1067) showed interest in clinical trials among which; males, primary school leavers, students, Christians, un-married, respondents who didn&#039;t earn any salary and rural dwellers had better odds and likelihood to participate in clinical trials. CONCLUSION: There was a low level of vaccine acceptance and clinical trial interest in western Uganda. Minority groups in the study i.e., Muslims, students, primary school leavers, un-married rural dwellers among others showed more interest in vaccination and clinical trials. We anticipated fears in the larger part of this community that health experts need to address through reassurance of the community that vaccines are tested and that they are safe and important if we are to rapidly contain the COVID-19 pandemic.","Echoru, Isaac; Ajambo, Patricia Decanar; Keirania, Emmanuel; Bukenya, Edmund E M",,MEDLINE,COVID-19 Vaccines; COVID-19; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Uganda; Vaccination,20210615.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11197-7,covidwho-1266483,1471-2458,1,BMC Public Health,en,GB,2021.0,"BMC Public Health;21(1): 1106, 2021 06 10.

"Objective To assess willingness for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine and identify the factors attributing to the willingness. Design A cross-sectional study was conducted, adopting an exponential, non-discriminative snowball sampling technique. The questionnaire collected the socio-demographic profile, history of COVID-19 infection, presence of co-morbidities (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, cancer), willingness, and preference of vaccine among participants. An online platform (Google Forms) was used to collect data from all over India. A total of 2032 Indian adults aged above 18 years were included in the study. Results Around 1598 (78.6%) expressed willingness to receive the COVID vaccine, and among the healthcare providers (HCPs), 579 (80.3%) were willing for COVID vaccination. Factors like the belief that the vaccine is necessary (aOR=1.68, 95% CI =1.34 to 2.11), respondents having no history of COVID infection (aOR=0.71, 95% CI: 0.52 to 0.97), having trust in the government (aOR=6.09, CI: 4.59 to 7.98), people who felt the cost of the vaccine didn&#039;t matter (aOR=4.92, CI: 3.80 to 6.37), and respondents with no perceived risk of COVID infection (aORKI.63;CI: 0.47 to 0.83) were more associated with willingness for COVID vaccination.

"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has a worldwide impact on all health services, including childhood immunizations. In Canada, there is limited data to quantify and characterize this issue. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional study by distributing online surveys to physicians across Ontario. The survey included three sections: provider characteristics, impact of COVID-19 on professional practice, and impact of COVID-19 on routine childhood immunization services. Multivariable logistic regression identified factors associated with modification of immunization services. RESULTS: A total of 475 respondents answered the survey from May 27th to July 3rd 2020, including 189 family physicians and 286 pediatricians. The median proportion of in-person visits reported by physicians before the pandemic was 99% and dropped to 18% during the first wave of the pandemic in Ontario. In total, 175 (44.6%) of the 392 respondents who usually provide vaccination to children acknowledged a negative impact caused by the pandemic on their immunization services, ranging from temporary closure of their practice (n?=?18; 4.6%) to postponement of vaccines in certain age groups (n?=?103; 26.3%). Pediatricians were more likely to experience a negative impact on their immunization services compared to family physicians (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]?=?2.64, 95% CI: 1.48-4.68), as well as early career physicians compared to their more senior colleagues (aOR?=?2.69, 95% CI: 1.30-5.56), whereas physicians from suburban settings were less impacted than physicians from urban settings (aOR?=?0.62, 95% CI: 0.39-0.99). Some of the proposed solutions to decreased immunization services included assistance in accessing personal protective equipment, dedicated centers or practices for vaccination, universal centralized electronic immunization records and education campaigns for parents. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has caused substantial modifications to pediatric immunization services across Ontario.

"OBJECTIVE: To assess antibody response to inactivated COVID-19 vaccine in patients with immune-mediated diseases (IMD) among hospital workers and people aged 65 and older. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we studied 82 hospital workers with IMD (mean age: 42.2 ¡À 10.0?years) and 300 (mean age: 41.7 ¡À 9.9?years) controls. Among + 65 aged population, we studied 22 (mean age: 71.4 ¡À 4.5?years) patients and 47 controls (mean age: 70.9 ¡À 4.8?years). All study subjects had a negative history for COVID-19. Sera were obtained after at least 21?days following the second vaccination. Anti-spike IgG antibody titers were measured quantitatively using a commercially available immunoassay method. RESULTS: Patients with IMD were significantly less likely to have detectable antibodies than healthy controls both among the hospital workers (92.7% vs 99.7%, p &lt; 0.001) and elderly population (77.3% vs 97.9%, p = 0.011). Among patients with IMD, those using immunosuppressive or immune-modulating drugs (64/75, 85.3%) were significantly less likely to have detectable antibodies compared to those off treatment (29/29, 100%) (p = 0.029). Additionally, a negative association between age and the antibody titer categories among patients (r = -?0.352; p &lt; 0.001) and controls (r = -?0.258; p &lt; 0.001) were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospital workers, the vast majority of patients with IMD and immunocompetent controls developed a significant humoral response following the administration of the second dose of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. This was also true for the elderly population, albeit with lower antibody titers. Immunosuppressive use, particularly rituximab significantly reduced antibody titers. Antibody titers were significantly lower among those aged &amp;#8805; 60?years both in patient and control populations.

"BACKGROUND: Vaccine hesitancy poses serious challenges for achieving coverage for population immunity. It is necessary to achieve high COVID-19 vaccination acceptance rates and medical students&#039; coverage as future health care providers. The study aimed to explore the level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and determine the factors and barriers that may affect vaccination decision-making. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out among medical students in Tanta and Kafrelsheikh Universities, Egypt. Data collection was done via an online questionnaire during January 2021 from 2133 students. RESULTS: The majority of the participant students (90.5%) perceived the importance of the COVID-19 vaccine, 46% had vaccination hesitancy, and an equal percentage (6%) either definitely accepted or refused the vaccine. Most of the students had concerns regarding the vaccine&#039;s adverse effects (96.8%) and ineffectiveness (93.2%). The most confirmed barriers of COVID-19 vaccination were deficient data regarding the vaccine&#039;s adverse effects (potential 74.17% and unknown 56.31%) and insufficient information regarding the vaccine itself (72.76%). CONCLUSION: The government, health authority decision-makers, medical experts, and universities in Egypt need to work together and make efforts to reduce hesitancy and raise awareness about vaccinations, consequently improving the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines.","Saied, Shimaa M; Saied, Eman M; Kabbash, Ibrahim Ali; Abdo, Sanaa Abd El-Fatah",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Students, Medical/psychology; Vaccination Refusal/psychology; Vaccination/psychology; COVID-19 Vaccines/therapeutic use; Cross-Sectional Studies; Egypt; Female; Humans; Male; Mass Vaccination/methods; Mass Vaccination/psychology; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",20210614.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26910,covidwho-1263092,1096-9071,7,J Med Virol,en,US,2021.0,"J Med Virol;93(7): 4280-4291, 2021 Jul.

"The study aimed to analyse the challenges and solutions for maintaining the continuity of essential health services during the COVID-19 pandemic in Francophone West Africa. A cross-sectional study involving the managers of Reproductive, Maternal, Neonatal, Child and Adolescent Health (RMNCAH) and vaccination programmes in Francophone West Africa was designed. The challenges that limited the supply and use of RMNCAH services included: lack of standardized guides and procedures for appropriate care, limited knowledge of health workers on the new coronavirus disease, lack of diagnostic materials and kits, ineffective organization of services, anxieties of health workers and populations, and postponement of immunisation mass campaigns. The solutions proposed to address these challenges, included better organization of services to respect the physical distance, provision of adapted guides and care procedures, enhanced communication, training of health workers, effective use of social media and information and communication technologies.

"The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the worst global crisis after World War II. Since the vaccine trials are still ongoing, the national lockdowns have been the most effective way to contain its spread. The pandemic has been extremely stressful and full of anxiety for those with comorbidities as they are the most vulnerable to the COVID-19 infections. Various efforts to assess and enhance the knowledge, attitudes, and practice, especially the high-risk groups, are critical to managing the COVID-19 pandemic successfully. A cross-sectional online survey was carried out using a self-designed questionnaire. A total of 383 participants who were 30 years or older, with at least one comorbidity, were included in the study. The mean age of the participants was 50.63¡À11.83 years. The most common comorbidities among the included participants were hypertension, followed by diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorders (48.5%, 44.7% and 23.3%, respectively). Our study also showed the education (p=0.004) and occupation (p=0.04) had a significant association with the attitude and practices towards the COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, our study showed that a high level of knowledge, attitude, and practices are the backbone to combat a global crisis like COVID-19.","Saeed, Shazina; Awasthi, Aanchal Anant; Nandi, Dhruv; Kaur, Karunanidhi; Hasan, Shamimul; Janardhanan, Rajiv",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/epidemiology; Comorbidity; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Adult; Anxiety Disorders/epidemiology; COVID-19/virology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics/prevention &amp;amp; control; SARS-CoV-2/physiology; Surveys and Questionnaires",20210611.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.25122/jml-2020-0184,covidwho-1262735,1844-3117,2,J Med Life,en,RO,2021.0,"J Med Life;14(2): 225-237, 2021.

"BACKGROUND: There are no pharmacological interventions currently available to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or to treat COVID-19. The development of vaccines against COVID-19 is essential to contain the pandemic. we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Shanghai residents to understand residents&#039; willingness to be vaccinated with any future COVID-19 vaccines and take measures to further improve vaccination coverage. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using self-administered anonymous questionnaires from 1 July to 8 September 2020. The main outcome was willingness of participants, and any children or older individuals living with them, to receive future COVID-19 vaccines. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore potential factors associated with vaccination willingness. RESULTS: A total of 1071 participants were asked about their willingness to receive future COVID-19 vaccines, for themselves and at least 747 children and 375 older individuals (&amp;#8805;60 years old) living with them. The highest proportion of expected willingness to vaccinate was among participants (88.6%), followed by children (85.3%) and older individuals (84.0%). The main reasons for reluctance to vaccinate among 119 participants were doubts regarding vaccine safety (60.0%) and efficacy (28.8%). Participants with a self-reported history of influenza vaccination were more likely to accept COVID-19 vaccines for themselves [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.83; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19-2.82], their children (adjusted OR = 2.08; 95%CI: 1.30-3.33), and older individuals in their household (adjusted OR = 2.12; 95%CI: 1.14-3.99). Participants with older individuals in their families were less willing to vaccinate themselves (adjusted OR = 0.59; 95%CI: 0.40-0.87) and their children (adjusted OR = 0.58; 95%CI: 0.38-0.89). CONCLUSIONS: Participants were more reluctant to accept COVID-19 vaccines for older individuals living with them. The presence of older individuals in the home also affected willingness of participants and their children to be vaccinated.","Zhou, Yehong; Zhang, Junjie; Wu, Wenwen; Liang, Man; Wu, Qiang-Song",,MEDLINE,COVID-19; Influenza Vaccines; Vaccines; COVID-19 Vaccines; Child; China/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Middle Aged; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination,20210611.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11174-0,covidwho-1262501,1471-2458,1,BMC Public Health,en,GB,2021.0,"BMC Public Health;21(1): 1103, 2021 06 09.

"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is a recently emerged pandemic coronavirus (CoV) capable of causing severe respiratory illness. However, a significant number of infected people present as asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic. In this prospective assessment of at-risk healthcare workers (HCWs) we seek to determine whether pre-existing antibody or T cell responses to previous seasonal human coronavirus (HCoV) infections affect immunological or clinical responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. METHODS: A cohort of 300 healthcare workers, confirmed negative for SARS-CoV-2 exposure upon study entry, will be followed for up to 1 year with monthly serology analysis of IgM and IgG antibodies against the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and the four major seasonal human coronavirus - HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63. Participants will complete monthly questionnaires that ask about Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure risks, and a standardized, validated symptom questionnaire (scoring viral respiratory disease symptoms, intensity and severity) at least twice monthly and any day when any symptoms manifest. SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing will be performed any time participants develop symptoms consistent with COVID-19. For those individuals that seroconvert and/or test positive by SARS-CoV-2 PCR, or receive the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, additional studies of T cell activation and cytokine production in response to SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools and analysis of Natural Killer cell numbers and function will be conducted on that participant&#039;s cryopreserved baseline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Following the first year of this study we will further analyze those participants having tested positive for COVID-19, and/or having received an authorized/licensed SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, quarterly (year 2) and semi-annually (years 3 and 4) to investigate immune response longevity. DISCUSSION: This study will determine the frequency of asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of at-risk healthcare workers. Baseline and longitudinal assays will determine the frequency and magnitude of anti-spike glycoprotein antibodies to the seasonal HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63, and may inform whether pre-existing antibodies to these human coronaviruses are associated with altered COVID-19 disease course. Finally, this study will evaluate whether pre-existing immune responses to seasonal HCoVs affect the magnitude and duration of antibody and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, adjusting for demographic covariates.","Jackson-Thompson, Belinda M; Goguet, Emilie; Laing, Eric D; Olsen, Cara H; Pollett, Simon; Hollis-Perry, K Monique; Maiolatesi, Santina E; Illinik, Luca; Ramsey, Kathleen F; Reyes, Anatalio E; Alcorta, Yolanda; Wong, Mimi A; Davies, Julian; Ortega, Orlando; Parmelee, Edward; Lindrose, Alyssa R; Moser, Matthew; Graydon, Elizabeth; Letizia, Andrew G; Duplessis, Christopher A; Ganesan, Anuradha; Pratt, Kathleen P; Malloy, Allison M; Scott, David W; Anderson, Stephen K; Snow, Andrew L; Dalgard, Clifton L; Powers, John H; Tribble, David; Burgess, Timothy H; Broder, Christopher C; Mitre, Edward",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/immunology; Health Personnel/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; Seroconversion; Vaccination/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Antibodies, Viral/blood; Antibodies, Viral/immunology; Asymptomatic Infections; COVID-19 Vaccines/immunology; Coronavirus/immunology; Cross Reactions; Humans; Prospective Studies; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus/immunology; T-Lymphocytes/immunology",20210611.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-06233-1,covidwho-1262498,1471-2334,1,BMC Infect Dis,en,GB,2021.0,"BMC Infect Dis;21(1): 544, 2021 Jun 09.

"Background: Healthcare services have responded to the challenges of service delivery during COVID-19 with telehealth and hybrid models of care. However, there is limited understanding of the experiences of care among people affected by cancer and how their experiences may change and evolve against the shifting landscape of COVID-19 incidence, mortality, vaccination and refinements in service delivery. Objectives: This study explores the experiences of cancer care among people affected by cancer in Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents the results of the initial cross-sectional semi-structured interviews and the longitudinal qualitative research design which will be employed in this study. Design: A longitudinal descriptive qualitative study. Setting: Ireland. Participants: People living with and after cancer or caring for someone with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Participants were recruited to the study via social media advertisements and consented to participate in up to three semi-structured interviews between January and July 2021. Initial semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 participants in January 2021. Participants completed measures of resilience (2-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale) and distress (The National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer). Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed thematically. Results: Participants reported low levels of distress and moderate to high levels of resilience on average. Three themes were generated from analysis of the first phase of cross-sectional interviews. Participants described a counterbalance of being cautious of infection and keeping safe through prevention and shielding strategies. Although hospitals felt safe and were working efficiently, some participants felt COVID-19 had compromised person-centredness and empathy in care. While participants valued the restrictions being taken to minimize infection risk, substitution of face-to-face appointments with telehealth services and attending essential face-to-face appointments alone restricted participants&#039; access to professional and social support. Despite this, many participants felt public health measures to reduce transmission of COVID-19 had created a sense of not missing out, feeling safe and reduced difficult social interactions requiring explanation of their diagnosis. Conclusions: There is an opportunity to learn from the experiences of healthcare delivery from the perspectives of people affected by cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results highlight the complexities and dualities of living with, after or caring for someone with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Opportunities for longitudinal qualitative research to explore the evolving experiences, concerns and persistent and emerging unmet information and clinical needs within the rapidly changing socio-political, socio-cultural and healthcare contexts of the COVID-19 pandemic are highlighted.","Drury, Dr Amanda; Eicher, Professor Manuela; Dowling, Dr Maura",,MEDLINE,,20210610.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnsa.2021.100030,covidwho-1260755,2666-142X,,Int J Nurs Stud Adv,en,GB,2021.0,"Int J Nurs Stud Adv;: 100030, 2021 May 27.

"Population-based immunoglobulin G (IgG) seroprevalence studies in asymptomatic individuals in Latin America are scarce. The objective of the study was to estimate the prevalence and geographic distribution of IgG antibodies induced by natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic adults, 5-8 months after the first case was reported in a northeastern state of Mexico. This was a population-based cross-sectional study carried out in Nuevo Leon during August-November 2020. Individuals &amp;#8805;18 years with no previous diagnosis or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 were consecutively screened in one of the busiest subway stations. Also, a search for eligible individuals was done from house-to-house, after selecting densely populated geographic sectors of each of the municipalities of the metropolitan area (n = 4495). The IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein were analyzed. The IgG antibody positivity rate was 27.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 25.8, 28.4); there were no differences by sex or age (p &gt; 0.05). Analysis by month showed a gradual increase from 11.9% (August) to 31.9% (November); Week 39 had the highest positivity rate (42.2%, 95% CI: 34.2, 50.7).

"Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus caused a global pandemic, the amount of misinformation in various media outlets has been on the rise. This has caused confusion among both healthcare workers and the general population about what the proper precautions against COVID-19 are. This study investigated attitudes towards misinformation related to protective measures that can be taken against COVID-19. The study was conducted in Saudi Arabia using an online survey questionnaire during the first three months of lockdown responding to the pandemic. The sample size of the study was N = 1294, of which 275 were healthcare workers and 974 were non-healthcare workers. The findings indicate that the Saudi Arabian population has a &quot;Neutral&quot; attitude towards COVID-19-related misinformation, meaning that, overall, they neither agree nor disagree with the most common COVID-19-related misinformation. Both healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers displayed a &quot;Neutral&quot; attitude towards herbal remedies for COVID-19. The level of agreement regarding the SARS-CoV-2 virus remaining in the throat for two days and the BCG vaccine protecting against COVID-19 was low. The findings of this research imply that knowledge dissemination is severely lacking in Saudi Arabia and that the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia should sincerely consider educating healthcare workers better about verified and true information regarding COVID-19. Conclusion: Future research should include larger sample sizes for each of the healthcare specialties surveyed in this study and analyse their attitudes towards COVID-19 misinformation.","Alotiby, Amna Abdullah; Al-Harbi, Laila Naif",,MEDLINE,,20210609.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18116123,covidwho-1259495,1660-4601,11,Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),en,CH,2021.0,Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(11)2021 Jun 06. ,Attitudes towards COVID-19-Related Medical Misinformation among Healthcare Workers and Non-Healthcare Workers in Saudi Arabia during the Pandemic: An Online Cross-Sectional Survey.,article,,,18
"Objective: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is currently available. This timely survey was conducted to provide insight into on the willingness of healthcare workers (HCWs)to receive the vaccine and determine the influencing factors. Methods: This was a cross-sectional online survey. An online questionnaire was provided to all participants and they were asked if they would accept a free vaccine. The questionnaire gathered general demographic information, and included the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12); Myers-Briggs Type Indicator questionnaire (MBTI); Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21); and the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). The data were collected automatically and electronically. Univariate analysis was done between all the variables and our dependent variable. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed to examine and identify the associations between the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine with the associated variables. Results: We collected 505 complete answers. The participants included 269 nurses (53.27%), 206 clinicians (40.79%), 15 administrative staff (2.97%), and 15 other staff (2.97%). Of these, 76.63% declared they would accept the vaccine. The major barriers were concerns about safety, effectiveness, and the rapid mutation in the virus. Moreover, four factors were significantly associated with the willingness to receive the vaccine: (a) &quot;understanding of the vaccine&quot; (odds ratio (OR):2.322; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.355 to 3.979); (b) &quot;worried about experiencing COVID-19&quot; (OR 1.987; 95% CI: 1.197-3.298); (c) &quot;flu vaccination in 2020&quot; (OR 4.730; 95% CI: 2.285 to 9.794); and (d) &quot;living with elderly individuals&quot; (OR 1.928; 95% CI: 1.074-3.462). Conclusions: During the vaccination period, there was still hesitation in receiving the vaccine.

"INTRODUCTION: One-third of the general public will not accept Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination but factors influencing vaccine acceptance among health care personnel (HCP) are not known. We investigated barriers and facilitators to vaccine acceptance within 3 months of regulatory approval (primary outcome) among adult employees and students at a tertiary-care, academic medical center. METHODS: We used a cross-sectional survey design with multivariable logistic regression. Covariates included age, gender, educational attainment, self-reported health status, concern about COVID-19, direct patient interaction, and prior influenza immunization. RESULTS: Of 18,250 eligible persons, 3,347 participated. Two in 5 (40.5%) HCP intend to delay (n = 1020; 30.6%) or forgo (n = 331; 9.9%) vaccination. Male sex (adjusted OR [aOR], 2.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.00-2.95; P &lt; .001), prior influenza vaccination (aOR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.75-3.18; P &lt; .001), increased concern about COVID-19 (aOR, 2.40; 95% CI, 2.07-2.79; P &lt; .001), and postgraduate education (aOR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.21-1.65; P &lt; .001) - but not age, direct patient interaction, or self-reported overall health - were associated with vaccine acceptance in multivariable analysis. Barriers to vaccination included concerns about long-term side effects (n = 1197, 57.1%), safety (n = 1152, 55.0%), efficacy (n = 777, 37.1%), risk-to-benefit ratio (n = 650, 31.0%), and cost (n = 255, 12.2%).Subgroup analysis of Black respondents indicates greater hesitancy to accept vaccination (only 24.8% within 3 months; aOR 0.13; 95% CI, 0.08-0.21; P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: Many HCP intend to delay or refuse COVID-19 vaccination. Policymakers should impartially address concerns about safety, efficacy, side effects, risk-to-benefit ratio, and cost. Further research with minority subgroups is urgently needed.","Parente, Daniel J; Ojo, Akinlolu; Gurley, Tami; LeMaster, Joseph W; Meyer, Mark; Wild, David M; Mustafa, Reem A",,MEDLINE,,20210609.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2021.03.200541,covidwho-1259320,1558-7118,3,J Am Board Fam Med,en,US,2021.0,"J Am Board Fam Med;34(3): 498-508, 2021.

"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccine is considered to be a key to limiting and eliminating infectious disease. But, the success of the vaccination program will rely on the rates of vaccine acceptance among the population. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine the factors that influence vaccine hesitancy and vaccine acceptance and to explore the unintended consequences of COVID-19 infections. The study will further explore the association between socio-demographic characteristics, health status, COVID-19 related knowledge, attitude, practice, and its influence on Vaccine hesitancy and acceptance among individuals living in urban and rural settings of Chennai, Tamil Nadu in the Southern state of India. METHODS: A cross-sectional study will be conducted between January 2021 and January 2023. A sample of approximately 25,000 individuals will be recruited and enrolled using a non-probability complete enumeration sampling method from eleven selected urban and rural settings of Chennai. The data will be collected at a one-time point by administering the questionnaire to the eligible study participants. The collected data will be used to assess the rates of vaccine acceptance, hesitancy as well as knowledge, attitudes, practices, and beliefs regarding COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccine. Lastly, the study questionnaire will be used to assess the unintended consequences of COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: A pilot of 2500 individuals has been conducted to pre-test the self-administered study questionnaire. The data collection initiated on March 1, 2021 and the initial results are planned for publication by June 2021. Descriptive analysis of the gathered data will be performed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS) v9.1 and reporting of the results will be done at 95% confidence interval and P=.049. The study will help explore the burden of vaccine acceptance and hesitancy among individuals living in urban and rural settings of Chennai. Further, it will help to examine the variables that influence vaccine acceptance and hesitancy. Lastly, the result findings will help to design and develop a user-centered informatics platform that can deliver multimedia-driven health educational modules tailored to facilitate vaccine uptake in varied settings. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed study will help in understanding the rate and determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy among the population of Chennai. The findings of the study would further facilitate the development of a multifaceted intervention to enhance vaccine acceptance among the population.","Surapaneni, Krishna Mohan; Kaur, Mahima; Kaur, Ritika; Grover, Ashoo; Joshi, Ashish",,MEDLINE,,20210609.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/29733,covidwho-1259307,1929-0748,,,en,CA,2021.0,JMIR Res Protoc;2021 May 13. ,"Examine the impact of COVID-19 Vaccine Communication, Acceptance and Practice (CO-VIN-CAP) on Vaccine hesitancy in an Indian setting: Protocol for a Cross-Sectional Study.",article,,,
"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has continued to spread in the United States and globally. Closely monitoring public engagement and perceptions of COVID-19 and preventive measures using social media data could provide important information for understanding the progress of current interventions and planning future programs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to measure the public&#039;s behaviors and perceptions regarding COVID-19 and its effects on daily life during 5 months of the pandemic. METHODS: Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms were used to identify COVID-19-related and unrelated topics in over 300 million online data sources from June 15 to November 15, 2020. Posts in the sample were geotagged by NetBase, a third-party data provider, and sensitivity and positive predictive value were both calculated to validate the classification of posts. Each post may have included discussion of multiple topics. The prevalence of discussion regarding these topics was measured over this time period and compared to daily case rates in the United States. RESULTS: The final sample size included 9,065,733 posts, 70% of which were sourced from the United States. In October and November, discussion including mentions of COVID-19 and related health behaviors did not increase as it had from June to September, despite an increase in COVID-19 daily cases in the United States beginning in October. Additionally, discussion was more focused on daily life topics (n=6,210,255, 69%), compared with COVID-19 in general (n=3,390,139, 37%) and COVID-19 public health measures (n=1,836,200, 20%). CONCLUSIONS: There was a decline in COVID-19-related social media discussion sourced mainly from the United States, even as COVID-19 cases in the United States increased to the highest rate since the beginning of the pandemic. Targeted public health messaging may be needed to ensure engagement in public health prevention measures as global vaccination efforts continue.","Massey, Daisy; Huang, Chenxi; Lu, Yuan; Cohen, Alina; Oren, Yahel; Moed, Tali; Matzner, Pini; Mahajan, Shiwani; Caraballo, C¨¦sar; Kumar, Navin; Xue, Yuchen; Ding, Qinglan; Dreyer, Rachel; Roy, Brita; Krumholz, Harlan",,MEDLINE,COVID-19/epidemiology; Public Health/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Social Media/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; United States/epidemiology; Vaccination,20210609.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/26655,covidwho-1259299,1438-8871,6,J Med Internet Res,en,CA,2021.0,"J Med Internet Res;23(6): e26655, 2021 06 21.

The results showed that majority of participants were aware of most common symptoms and causes of COVID-19 and had positive attitude toward the protective measures against the disease. Regarding the acceptability of vaccination against COVID-19, around 44% of the total participants showed hesitancy to uptake the vaccine of whom, 68.3% were concerned about the adverse effects of the vaccine. Significant differences were found between gender and current position at university of Jeddah in term of vaccine acceptance with p-values of &amp;lt; 0.001. Despite this high level of awareness, health field community at the university of Jeddah have medium acceptance level of disease vaccine. Thus, health educational programs are important to increase the acceptance level among such societies which will contribute to increase the acceptance level among the whole society.

"Introduction: Understanding suburban, Kansas parental attitudes and adherence of recommended childhood vaccination schedules adopts a new level of importance in the era of the SARS-CoV-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. With hopes for release of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine underway, understanding parental perception of vaccines is important to design successful vaccination interventions. Methods: A web-based, cross-sectional survey was administered to approximately 900 parents in Johnson County, Kansas during the summer of 2020. Pearson chi square and Mann-Whitney U tests were utilized to assess the attitudes of Kansas parents towards a potential addition of the influenza vaccine to the required list for K-12 students and furthermore, their general perception of vaccinations, and the impact of COVID-19 on those beliefs. Results: A total of 179 parents responded. Fifty-one percent (n = 92) were in favor of adding the influenza vaccine to the mandatory list (Pro-Addition). Anti-Addition parents had significantly higher levels of distrust (2.1, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and were significantly more concerned about vaccine adverse effects. When presented with a hypothetical situation in which a &quot;safe and effective&quot; COVID-19 vaccine was available, 24% of Anti-Addition parents indicated they would receive the vaccine or obtain it for their children (21 people, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Kansas suburban parents were split on their attitudes towards the addition of the influenza vaccine to the required list for children and the effects of the pandemic. Follow-up qualitative studies of Anti-Addition parents are critical for successful vaccine distribution and coverage in the communities.","Beatty, S.

"Oman is globally acknowledged for its well-structured immunization program with high vaccination coverage. The massive spread of misinformation brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the easy access to various media channels, may affect acceptance of a vaccine, despite the inherent trust in the local system. This cross-sectional study evaluated the knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) in Oman toward COVID-19 vaccines. It included 3000 randomly selected adults answering a structured questionnaire via telephone. Participants were 66.7% Omani, 76% male, and 83.7% without comorbidities. Their mean age was 38.27 years (SD ¡À 10.45). Knowledge of COVID-19¡äs symptoms, mode of transmission, and attitudes toward the disease was adequate;88.4% had heard of the vaccine, 59.3% would advise others to take it, 56.8% would take it themselves, and 47.5% would take a second dose. Males (CI = 2.37, OR = (2.00¨C2.81)) and non-Omanis (CI = 0.49, OR = (0.42¨C0.57)) were more willing to be vaccinated. The history of chronic disease, source of vaccine knowledge, and education level were factors that affected the willingness to accept the vaccine. The Omani community¡¯s willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine can be enhanced by utilizing social media and community influencers to spread awareness about the vaccine¡¯s safety and efficacy.","Al-Marshoudi, Sabria, Al-Balushi, Haleema, Al-Wahaibi, Adil, Al-Khalili, Sulien, Al-Maani, Amal, Al-Farsi, Noura, Al-Jahwari, Adhari, Al-Habsi, Zeyana, Al-Shaibi, Maryam, Al-Msharfi, Mahfoodh, Al-Ismaili, Ahlam, Al-Buloshi, Hood, Al-Rawahi, Bader, Al-Barwani, Khalifa, Al-Abri, Seif",,MDPI,,20210609.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9060602,covidwho-1259644,,6,Vaccines,en,,2021.0,"Vaccines; 9(6):602, 2021.","Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) toward the COVID-19 Vaccine in Oman: A Pre-Campaign Cross-Sectional Study",article,,,9
"Seroprevalence studies are important for understanding the dynamics of local virus transmission and evaluating community immunity. To assess the seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in Allegheny County, an urban/suburban county in Western PA, 393 human blood samples collected in Fall 2020 and February 2021 were examined for spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (N) antibodies. All RBD-positive samples were evaluated for virus-specific neutralization activity. Our results showed a seroprevalence of 5.5% by RBD ELISA, 4.5% by N ELISA, and 2.5% for both in Fall 2020, which increased to 24.7% by RBD ELISA, 14.9% by N ELISA, and 12.9% for both in February 2021. Neutralization titer was significantly correlated with RBD titer but not with N titer. Using these two assays, we were able to distinguish infected from vaccinated individuals. In the February cohort, higher median income and white race were associated with serological findings consistent with vaccination. This study demonstrates a 4.5-fold increase in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence from Fall 2020 to February 2021 in Allegheny County, PA, due to increased incidence of both natural disease and vaccination. Future seroprevalence studies will need to include the effect of vaccination on assay results and incorporate non-vaccine antigens in serological assessments.","Xu, Lingqing, Doyle, Joshua, Barbeau, Dominique J.; Le Sage, Valerie, Wells, Alan, Duprex, W.

"Few studies have assessed attitudes and beliefs of school teachers on vaccination. Our cross-sectional questionnaire-based prospective survey aims to explore vaccination coverage and relevant knowledge of school teachers in Greece. Out of the 217 respondents, 93% believe that vaccines offer protection but only 69.7% were completely vaccinated as per adults&#039; National Immunization Schedule. In multivariate analysis, female gender, being a parent, beliefs that vaccination should be mandatory and imposing penalties to vaccine refusals are the main factors that account for teachers&#039; &quot;behavioral&quot; variability towards vaccination.

"BACKGROUND: Recent emergency authorisation and rollout of COVID-19 vaccines by regulatory bodies has generated global attention. As the most popular video-sharing platform globally, YouTube is a potent medium for dissemination of key public health information. Understanding the nature of available content regarding COVID-19 vaccination on this widely used platform is of substantial public health interest. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the reliability and quality of information of YouTube videos regarding COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, the phrases &#039;coronavirus vaccine&#039; and &#039;COVID-19 vaccine&#039; were searched on the UK version of YouTube on December 10, 2020. The 200 most-viewed videos of each search were extracted and screened for relevance and English language. Video content and characteristics were extracted and independently rated against Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct (HONcode) and DISCERN quality criteria for consumer health information by two authors. RESULTS: Forty-eight videos, with a combined total view count of 30,100,561, were included in the analysis. Topics addressed comprised: vaccine science (58%), vaccine trials (58%), side effects (48%), efficacy (35%) and manufacturing (17%). Twenty-one percent of videos encouraged continued public health measures. Only 4.2% of videos made non-factual claims. Ninety-eight percent of video content was scored to have low (56%) or moderate (42%) adherence to HONcode principles. Median overall DISCERN score per channel type ranged from 40.3 (34.8-47) to 64.3 (58.5-66.3). Educational channels produced by both medical and non-medical professionals achieved significantly higher DISCERN scores than other categories. The highest DISCERN scores were achieved by educational videos produced by medical professionals (64.3 (58.5-66.3)) and the lowest scores by independent users (18 (18-20)). CONCLUSIONS: Overall quality and reliability of information on YouTube regarding COVID-19 vaccines remains poor. Videos produced by educational channels, especially by medical professionals, were higher in quality and reliability than those produced by other sources, including health-related organisations. Collaboration between health-related organisations and established medical and educational YouTube content producers provides an opportunity for dissemination of high-quality information regarding COVID-19 vaccination. Such collaboration holds potential as a rapidly implementable public health intervention aiming to engage a wide audience and increase public vaccination awareness and knowledge.","Chan, Calvin; Sounderajah, Viknesh; Daniels, Elisabeth; Acharya, Amish; Clarke, Jonathan; Yalamanchili, Seema; Normahani, Pasha; Markar, Sheraz; Ashrafian, Hutan; Darzi, Ara",,MEDLINE,,20210608.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/29942,covidwho-1256283,2369-2960,,,en,CA,2021.0,JMIR Public Health Surveill;2021 May 21. ,YouTube as a source of public health information regarding COVID-19 vaccination: an assessment of reliability and quality of video content.,article,,,
"Background: It is unclear how people with hypertension are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic given their increased risk, and whether targeted public health strategies are needed. Objective: This retrospective case-control study compared people with hypertension to matched healthy controls during the COVID-19 lockdown to determine whether they have higher risk perceptions, anxiety, and vaccination intentions. Methods: Baseline data from a national survey were collected in April 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdown in Australia. People who reported hypertension with no other chronic conditions were randomly matched to healthy controls of similar age, gender, education, and health literacy level. A subset including participants with hypertension was followed up at 2 months after restrictions were eased. Risk perceptions, anxiety, and vaccination intentions were measured in April and June. Results: Of the 4362 baseline participants, 466 (10.7%) reported hypertension with no other chronic conditions. A subset of 1369 people were followed up at 2 months, which included 147 (10.7%) participants with hypertension. At baseline, perceived seriousness was high for both hypertension and control groups. The hypertension group reported greater anxiety compared to the controls and were more willing to vaccinate against influenza, but COVID-19 vaccination intentions were similar. At follow-up, these differences were no longer present in the longitudinal subsample. Perceived seriousness and anxiety had decreased, but vaccination intentions for both influenza and COVID-19 remained high across groups (&gt;80%). Conclusions: Anxiety was above normal levels during the COVID-19 lockdown. It was higher in the hypertension group, which also had higher vaccination intentions. Groups that are more vulnerable to COVID-19 may require targeted mental health screening during periods of greater risk. Despite a decrease in perceived risk and anxiety after 2 months of lockdown restrictions, vaccination intentions remained high, which is encouraging for the future prevention of COVID-19.","Bonner, Carissa; Cvejic, Erin; Ayre, Julie; Isautier, Jennifer; Semsarian, Christopher; Nickel, Brooke; Batcup, Carys; Pickles, Kristen; Dodd, Rachael; Cornell, Samuel; Copp, Tessa; McCaffery, Kirsten J",,MEDLINE,,20210608.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/25610,covidwho-1256247,2563-6316,1,JMIRx Med,en,,2021.0,"JMIRx Med;2(1): e25610, 2021.

"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus infections are spreading rapidly worldwide, and primary and middle schools are closed in many countries. After the state of emergency was lifted in Japan, schools have reopened, and teachers are conducting face-to-face classes while maintaining safety precautions. This study aimed to assess the factors contributing to infection-related anxiety and educational anxiety among teachers conducting face-to-face classes during the COVID-19 pandemic after schools reopened. METHODS: This questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted with 263 primary and middle school teachers in the Shinagawa area of Tokyo (October 10-30, 2020). The questionnaire assessed the type of school (primary or middle school), sex, age, and factors contributing to infection-related anxiety and educational anxiety that arose from the pandemic. The levels of anxiety and the factors contributing to anxiety were assessed using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very anxious). RESULTS: In an analysis of the data of 237 participants excluding the missing data, many teachers reported feeling infection- and education-related anxiety. A majority of the participants were women (n = 152, 64.1%), and the mean age of the participants was 39.8 ¡À 11.3 years. A stepwise multiple regression analysis identified six factors for infection-related anxiety as significant (R2 = 0.61, p &lt; 0.001). Among these variables, the largest partial regression coefficient value was reported for the following reason: &quot;I feel anxious because we cannot ensure the safety of teachers themselves or of their families&quot; (? = 0.37, p &lt; 0.001). For educational anxiety, four of six reasons were identified as significant (R2 = 0.64, p &lt; 0.001). Among these, &quot;anxiety about the students&#039; home situations&quot; (? = 0.41, p &lt; 0.001) and &quot;delay in education (students&#039; side)&quot; (? = 0.27, p &lt;?0.001) had stronger associations with anxiety compared to the others. CONCLUSION: In-person education during the COVID-19 pandemic has caused teachers to experience anxiety. This report provides useful information by highlighting the reasons for infection-related anxiety and educational anxiety that teachers experience in face-to-face classes during a pandemic. Even if the coverage of a COVID-19 vaccine becomes widespread worldwide, we will still be combating COVID-19 infections for at least a few years. Given concerns regarding such infections, to ensure students&#039; right to education, it is essential to understand why teachers feel anxious and to determine appropriate measures to decrease such anxiety.","Wakui, Nobuyuki; Abe, Shinichiro; Shirozu, Shunsuke; Yamamoto, Yuuki; Yamamura, Miho; Abe, Yasuyo; Murata, Souichi; Ozawa, Mizue; Igarashi, Takahiro; Yanagiya, Takahiro; Machida, Yoshiaki; Kikuchi, Mayumi",,MEDLINE,COVID-19; Pandemics; Adult; Anxiety/epidemiology; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Japan/epidemiology; Male; Middle Aged; SARS-CoV-2; Schools; Tokyo,20210608.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11130-y,covidwho-1255926,1471-2458,1,BMC Public Health,en,GB,2021.0,"BMC Public Health;21(1): 1050, 2021 06 02.

"Dental care professionals (DCPs) are thought to be at enhanced risk of occupational exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, robust data to support this from large-scale seroepidemiological studies are lacking. We report a longitudinal seroprevalence analysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, with baseline sampling prior to large-scale practice reopening in July 2020 and follow-up postimplementation of new public health guidance on infection prevention control (IPC) and enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE). In total, 1,507 West Midlands DCPs were recruited into this study in June 2020. Baseline seroprevalence was determined using a combined IgGAM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the cohort followed longitudinally for 6 mo until January/February 2021 through the second wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in the United Kingdom and vaccination commencement. Baseline seroprevalence was 16.3%, compared to estimates in the regional population of 6% to 7%. Seropositivity was retained in over 70% of participants at 3- and 6-mo follow-up and conferred a 75% reduced risk of infection. Nonwhite ethnicity and living in areas of greater deprivation were associated with increased baseline seroprevalence. During follow-up, no polymerase chain reaction-proven infections occurred in individuals with a baseline anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG level greater than 147.6 IU/ml with respect to the World Health Organization international standard 20-136. After vaccination, antibody responses were more rapid and of higher magnitude in those individuals who were seropositive at baseline. Natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 prior to enhanced PPE was significantly higher in DCPs than the regional population. Natural infection leads to a serological response that remains detectable in over 70% of individuals 6 mo after initial sampling and 9 mo from the peak of the first wave of the pandemic. This response is associated with protection from future infection. Even if serological responses wane, a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech 162b vaccine is associated with an antibody response indicative of immunological memory.","Shields, A M; Faustini, S E; Kristunas, C A; Cook, A M; Backhouse, C; Dunbar, L; Ebanks, D; Emmanuel, B; Crouch, E; Kr?ger, A; Hirschfeld, J; Sharma, P; Jaffery, R; Nowak, S; Gee, S; Drayson, M T; Richter, A G; Dietrich, T; Chapple, I L C",,MEDLINE,,20210608.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00220345211020270,covidwho-1255788,1544-0591,,J Dent Res,en,US,2021.0,"J Dent Res;: 220345211020270, 2021 Jun 02.

"BACKGROUND: Understanding healthcare workers (HCWs) willingness to receive a future vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be useful. METHODS: Cross-sectional study, conducted in Italy from September 14th to November 30th, 2020, among 811 HCWs who undergo a voluntary antibody-testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The perceived risk level of developing COVID-19, measured on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 to 10, was 6.6 and it was higher among females, older HCWs, and in those who agreed that COVID-19 is a severe disease. Married/cohabitant, not physicians, and those who needed additional information regarding the vaccination against COVID-19 were more likely to be concerned that COVID-19 vaccination might not be safe. Males, physicians, those who did not have had any symptom compatible with COVID-19, those who agreed that COVID-19 is a severe disease, those who perceived to be at higher risk of developing COVID-19, those who were not concerned about the vaccine&#039;s safety, and those who had received information regarding the COVID-19 vaccination from scientific journals expressed willingness to receive vaccination against COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Communication and education targeted to groups with lowest willingness are needed to raise awareness regarding the safety and benefits of the vaccination and to improve vaccine uptake.","Di Giuseppe, Gabriella; Pelullo, Concetta P; Della Polla, Giorgia; Montemurro, Maria V; Napolitano, Francesco; Pavia, Maria; Angelillo, Italo F",,MEDLINE,,20210608.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2021.1922081,covidwho-1254220,1744-8395,,Expert Rev Vaccines,en,GB,2021.0,"Expert Rev Vaccines;: 1-9, 2021 May 25.

"Objective: This study investigates the association of preventive measures with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) seropositivity. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Combined Military Hospital Kharian Medical College, Pakistan, in September 2020. A total of 442 participants from three different strata (faculty, students, and administration/technical staff) were enrolled using a convenient sampling technique. A rapid antibody testing method was used to detect antibodies. The Ichroma&amp;#8482; COVID-19 Ab test is an in?vitro diagnostic device that helps in the rapid identification of COVID-19 by measuring the levels of IgG and IgM antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the blood. An automated fluorescent immunoassay system (AFIAS-6), with a clinical sensitivity of 95.8% and specificity of 96.7%, was used for qualitative analysis. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data, and data analysis was performed using SPSS version 25. Results: In total, 442 participants were included in the study: 40 (9%) faculty members, 299 (67%) students, and 103 (23.3%) administrative/technical staff. As many as 14.9% of the participants were symptomatic; 32.4% always used masks, and 14% never wore masks. Furthermore, 69.7% of participants frequently washed their hands for 20?s, and 75.6% were aware of social distancing. A total of 16.96% of participants tested positive for IgG antibodies. Moreover, most of the administration/technical staff who tested positive for IgG were asymptomatic (68.42%). A significant association (p?&lt;?0.001) was found between following the safety guidelines (wearing masks, handwashing, and social distancing) and the occurrence of COVID-19. Conclusion: This study showed a higher seroprevalence rate than other studies as it was conducted toward the end of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we are still far from achieving herd immunity.

"BACKGROUND: Parental attitudes towards the vaccines play a key role in the success of the herd immunity for the COVID-19. Psychological health seems to be a controversial determinant of vaccine hesitancy and remains to be investigated. This study attempted to measure parental psychological distress, attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine, and to explore the potential associations. METHODS: An online survey using convenience sampling method was conducted among parents within the school public health network of Shenzhen. Demographic information and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination were collected. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) was applied to measure psychological distress. RESULTS: Overall, 4,748 parents were included (average age: 40.28, standard deviation: 5.08). More than one fifth of them demonstrated psychological distress, in which only 3.3% were moderate to severe symptom. The proportions of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy for themselves, their spouses, and their children were 25.2%, 26.1%, and 27.3%, respectively. Parents with psychological distress were more likely to suffer vaccine hesitancy for themselves (OR: 1.277, 95%CI: 1.091~1.494), for their spouses (OR:1.276, 95%CI: 1.088~1.496) and children (OR:1.274, 95%CI: 1.092~1.486). These associations tended to be more significant among parents with mild or severe psychological distress. LIMITATION: Non-random sampling limited the generalization of our findings to all parents. CONCLUSION: Parents had a low level of psychological distress but relatively high willingness of COVID-19 vaccination when there was no local epidemic but persistent risk of imported cases. Targeted health education and intervention strategies should be provided to people with vaccine hesitancy, especially for those who are susceptible to psychological distress.","Xu, Yucheng; Zhang, Ruiyin; Zhou, Zhifeng; Fan, Jingjie; Liang, Jing; Cai, Lin; Peng, Lin; Ren, Fangmei; Lin, Wei",,MEDLINE,,20210608.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.06.003,covidwho-1253109,1573-2517,,J Affect Disord,en,NL,2021.0,"J Affect Disord;292: 552-558, 2021 Jun 06.

"BACKGROUND: Acceleration of mass vaccination strategies is the only pathway to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare professionals and students have a key role in shaping public opinion about vaccines. This study aimed to evaluate the attitudes of dental students globally towards COVID-19 vaccines and explore the potential drivers for students&#039; acceptance levels. METHODS: A global cross-sectional study was carried out in February 2021 using an online questionnaire. The study was liaised by the scientific committee of the International Association of Dental Students (IADS), and data were collected through the national and local coordinators of IADS member organizations. The dependent variable was the willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine, and the independent variables included demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related experience, and the drivers of COVID-19 vaccine-related attitude suggested by the WHO SAGE. RESULTS: A total of 6639 students from 22 countries, representing all world regions, responded to the questionnaire properly. Their mean age was 22.1 +/- 2.8 (17-40) years, and the majority were females (70.5%), in clinical years (66.8%), and from upper-middle-income economies (45.7%). In general, 22.5% of dental students worldwide were hesitant, and 13.9% rejected COVID-19 vaccines. The students in low- and lower-middle-income (LLMI) economies had significantly higher levels of vaccine hesitancy compared to their peers in upper-middle- and high-income (UMHI) economies (30.4% vs. 19.8%;p &amp;lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The global acceptance level of dental students for COVID-19 vaccines was suboptimal, and their worrisome level of vaccine hesitancy was influenced by the socioeconomic context where the dental students live and study. The media and social media, public figures, insufficient knowledge about vaccines, and mistrust of governments and the pharmaceutical industry were barriers to vaccination. The findings of this study call for further implementation of epidemiology (infectious diseases) education within undergraduate dental curricula.","Riad, A.; Abdulqader, H.; Morgado, M.; Domnori, S.; Koscik, M.; Mendes, J.

"The usage of face masks has been mandated in many countries in an attempt to diminish the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to determine face mask-wearing behaviors and practices in 1173 young Polish people during the second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in October 2020. The majority of respondents (97.4%) declared that they wore face masks in areas/situations where it is mandatory. The most common types of utilized face masks were cloth masks (47.7%) and surgical masks (47%), followed by respirators (N95/FFP3) (3.2%) and half-face elastomeric respirators (0.9%). Over 38% reported frequently disinfecting their face masks, especially females.

"Objectives: Young adults are essential to the effective mitigation of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19) given their tendency toward greater frequency of social interactions. Little is known about vaccine willingness during pandemics in European populations. This study examined young people&#039;s attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines in Fall 2020. Methods: Data came from an ongoing longitudinal study&#039;s online COVID-19-focused supplement among young adults aged 22 in Zurich, Switzerland (N = 499) in September 2020. Logistic regressions examined young adults&#039; likelihood of participating in COVID-19 immunization programs. Results: Approximately half of respondents reported being unlikely to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Compared to males, females were more likely to oppose COVID-19 vaccination (p &amp;lt; 0.05). In multivariate models, Sri Lankan maternal background and higher socioeconomic status were associated with a greater likelihood of getting vaccinated against COVID-19 (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Respondents were more likely to report a willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 when they perceived 1) an effective government response (p &amp;lt; 0.05) and 2) their information sources to be objective (p &amp;lt; 0.05).

"Background: Acceptance of a vaccine or hesitancy towards it have great public health implications as they partly determine the extent to which people are exposed to infections that could have otherwise been prevented. The present study examined the willingness of primary and secondary school teachers, bank employees, and university instructors in southern Ethiopia to take a Covid-19 vaccine and the factors associated with their willingness. Methods: An institutional-based cross-sectional study design was used with a quantitative research approach. Primary data were gathered mainly through the use of a survey research method in which a self-administered questionnaire was distributed to randomly selected research participants in Wolaita Sodo town. Data analysis was conducted using statistical techniques, including percentages, frequency distributions, and logistic regression analysis. Results: Research participants generally had a low (46.1%) willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine. The main reason for most (37%) respondents&#039; hesitancy to take the vaccine is found to be the concern over the safety and/or the side effects of the vaccine (37%), followed by doubt about the vaccine&#039;s effectiveness (20.7%), and lack of adequate information (12.7%). Moreover, 38.9% of survey participants revealed that they would like to take a COVID-19 vaccine other than AstraZeneca whereas 61.1% of respondents replied that they do not want to take any kind of COVID-19 vaccine. Furthermore, respondents&#039; willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine is significantly associated with attitude towards the vaccine (OR = 2.830;95% CI = 1.834-4.368), belief that Covid-19 exists in the study area (OR = 0.221;95% CI = 0.083-0.589), the perception that prevalence and death rate reports of the government are real (OR = 0.365;95% CI = 0.197-0.676), status of chronic diseases (OR = 2.883;95%CI = 1.039-7.999), and having a close relative/friend ever infected by COVID-19 (OR = 2.602;95% CI = 1.117-6.063). Conclusion: The findings of the research demonstrated that there is generally low willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine among university instructors, bank employees, and primary and secondary school teachers in southern Ethiopia. Therefore, the federal ministry of health, Ethiopian food and drug controlling agency, the media, and all other concerned organizations should create increased awareness about the safety/side effects issues and the need to take the vaccine.","Zewude, B.; Habtegiorgis, T.",,MEDLINE,,20210608.0,https://doi.org/10.2147/POR.S313991,covidwho-1256180,,,Pragmatic &amp; Observational Research,en,,2021.0,"Pragmatic &amp; Observational Research; 12:37-47, 2021.",Willingness to Take COVID-19 Vaccine Among People Most at Risk of Exposure in Southern Ethiopia,article,,,12
"Introduction: Although many vaccines are in development and clinical trials, and at least seven vaccines have been distributed worldwide, the world has faced a huge challenge in line with the willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine in a different country including Ethiopia. However, no study has been conducted on the knowledge, attitudes, acceptance, and determinates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, acceptance, and determinants of acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among the adult population in Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 492 study participants from March 1 to March 15, 2021. A multistage sampling technique was used to recruit study participants. Six skilled and qualified data collectors had participated to gather the data using a pretested structured-administered questionnaire. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. P-value &amp;lt; 0.05 was considered to indicate statistically significant association. Results: This study revealed that the level of good knowledge, positive attitude and intention to accept the COVID-19 vaccine were 74%, 44.7%, and 62.6%, respectively. Moreover, having an age ¡Ý 46 years with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.36 [95% CI, 1.09¨C 5.39], attended secondary and above education adjusted odds ratio 2.59 [95% CI, 1.52¨C 4.39], having a chronic disease adjusted odds ratio of 3.14 [95% CI, 1.21¨C 8.14], and having good knowledge about COVID-19 vaccine adjusted odds ratio 2.59 [95% CI, 1.67¨C 4.02] were significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Conclusion: In this study, the level of good knowledge, positive attitude, and intention to accept the COVID-19 vaccine were 74%, 44.7%, and 62.6%, respectively. Thus, health education and communication from government sources are very crucial methods to alleviate the negative attitude of the COVID-19 vaccine.","Abebe, Haimanot, Solomon, Shitu, Ayenew, Mose",,ProQuest Central,,20210608.0,https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S312116,covidwho-1256164,,,Infection and Drug Resistance,en,,2021.0,"Infection and Drug Resistance; 14:2015-2025, 2021.","Understanding of COVID-19 Vaccine Knowledge, Attitude, Acceptance, and Determinates of COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance Among Adult Population in Ethiopia",article,,,14

"Background: Further knowledge on adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) in children is needed in order to define possible immunization strategies and reconsider pandemic control measures. We analyzed anti-CoV-2 antibodies (Ab) and their neutralizing activity (PRNT), alongside antigen (Ag) specific cellular response, in relation to virus load in nasopharyngeal swabs. Methods: We analysed 42 CoV-2 patients at 7 days after symptoms onset. CoV-2 viral load (VL) was measured by RT-PCR and digital droplet PCR on longitudinal samples of nasopharyngeal swabs (NP). Virus infectivity (FFU) was tested by virus focus forming assay. CoV-2 antibodies were investigated by Diasorin (CoV-2 Ab) and neutralization assay (PRNT). CoV-2-specific CD4-CD40L+ T-cells and Spike specific B-cells were analysed by flow cytometry. Plasma proteomic profiling was measured by 2 Olink panels. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) of the viral load from NP collected every 48 hours up to undetectable VL. Mann-Whitney was used to compare means in individuals with neutralizing activity (PRNT+) or not (PRNT-);linear regression was used to evaluate the associations between virus load and infectivity over time. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to analyse proteomic data. Results: Higher VL was found in seronegative patients expressed in terms of both CoV-2 Ab (p=0.003) and PRNT (p=0.0007). Similarly, lower FFU was associated with higher CoV-2 Ab (p=0.003;rho=-0.67) and PRNT (p=0.023;rho=-0.46). Further, the AUC of the viral load in NP showed an inverse correlation with CoV-2 Ab (p=0.031;rho=-0.54). Development of humoral response was associated with the presence of CoV-2 specific IgD-CD27+ B cells, with a higher frequency of CoV-2 specific B cells found in seropositive compared to seronegative (p=0.001). Besides, individuals developing neutralizing Ab had higher frequency CD4-CD40L+ T-cells compared to PRNT- (p=0.03). The plasma proteome confirmed the association between cellular and humoral CoV-2 immunity, with PRNT+ showing higher viral signal transduction molecules (SLAMF1, CD244, CLEC4G). Conclusion: This work provides a virological and immunological characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infected children presenting a differential Abmediated neutralizing activity. It demonstrates that children with neutralizing antibodies present reduced viral load, faster virus clearance and lower in vitro infectivity. These data provide information that can drive vaccination endpoints and quarantine measures policies.","Ruggiero, A.; Cotugno, N.; Francesco, B.; Petrara, M. R.; Pascucci, G.

"Background: One of the fundamental pillars of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic control and vaccine development is understanding mid-and long-term immunity. Early humoral response has been extensively studied, however data on what recovered individuals are still scarce and the most recent studies are based on few time points over time, which limits the comprehension of the longitudinal pattern of the potential changes. In this study we have evaluated the neutralizing activity and IgG antibody titer against SARS-CoV-2 in mild/ asymptomatic and hospitalized COVID-19 individuals, over a 6-month period. Methods: We have evaluated the kinetics of the humoral immune response in 210 individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 covering the first and second waves of COVID-19 outbreak in Catalonia (Spain). IgG antibody titer was evaluated with an in-house sandwich ELISA against the S2 subunit, the binding domain receptor (RBD) and the nucleoprotein (NP) and the neutralizing activity was evaluated by a neutralization assay with HIV reporter pseudoviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Statistical analyses were carried out using mixed-effects non-linear and linear models. Results: Most study participants developed a neutralizing humoral response against SARS-CoV-2, however the maximum neutralization titer was 10-fold lower in mild/asymptomatic individuals compared to those with a more severe illness. We observed a slow and progressive decay of neutralizing activity in individuals with mild or asymptomatic disease throughout the 6-month period. In hospitalized individuals, half maximal neutralization activity was achieved on day 10 and showed an initial rapid decline that significantly slowed and remained nearly flat after day 80. Despite this, activity at six months remained higher in hospitalized individuals compared to mild symptomatic participants. On the other hand, we observed that IgG antibody titers against S2, RBD and NP had a more marked fall without showing differences in the decay pattern between individuals with different degree of severity of the disease. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the neutralizing activity remains relatively stable for more than 6 months despite the decline in IgG antibodies, suggesting that the quality of immune response evolves and allows maintaining the neutralizing activity despite the decay in antibody titers. Our results provide a more detailed picture of the behavior of the natural humoral immune response over time that complements the current evidence on mid-term immunity.","Pradenas, E.; Trinit¨¦, B.; Urrea, V.; Marfil, S.; ¨¢vila-Nieto, C.; De La Concepci¨®n, M.

"Background: Immune dysfunction characterized by lower antibody (Ab) response to infection or vaccination has been well described among People Living with HIV (PLWH), but due to the novelty of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has not been evaluated among PLWH coinfected with SARS-CoV-2. This study compared the magnitude and longevity of Ab response to SARS-CoV-2 in a group of HIV+ and HIV-individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 Methods: 17 HIV+COVID+ and 19 HIV-COVID+ participants were recruited from the community as part of the ACTION study and followed longitudinally at day 14, 1 month and 3 months. HIV+ were on effective ART (plasma viral load &amp;lt;500 copies/ml). SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by SARS-COV2 DNA PCR and rapid antibody test. All participants had mild/moderate COVID-19 without hospitalization. Antibody responses (IgG and IgM) were measured using an indirect in house developed ELISA using spike RBD antigen (courtesy, Scott Boyd, Stanford University) and the data are expressed as relative Ab units based on the positive control standard. Results: The median age of HIV+ participants was 55 (26-63) with 23.5% (4/17) females. The median age for HIV-was 38 (27-78) with 57.8% (11/19) females. Time from COVID-19 diagnosis was 26 days for HIV+ and 21 for HIV-. Mean CD4 count for the HIV+ participants was 859.5 ¡À 287.2 cells/¦Ìl. Longitudinal analysis did not show a significant reduction in Ab response at 3 months in either HIV+ or HIV-groups. Levels of SARS-CoV-2 RBD specific IgM and IgG responses did not differ significantly between HIV+ and HIV-at any timepoint although there was a trend of lower IgM and IgG responses at 3 months in both groups compared to entry levels. Age was correlated with IgG response at day 14 (r =0.6, p = 0.02), 1 month (r =0.6, p = 0.014) and 3 month(r =0.87, p = 0.0008) in HIV+ and weakly correlated at day 14 (r =0.46, p = 0.04) in HIV-. Absolute CD4 count was not correlated with IgM and IgG responses in HIV+. Conclusion: The magnitude and persistence of Ab response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the 3-4 months post-infection does not differ by HIV status. Although extended longitudinal follow-ups are required to gain insights about the longevity of Ab responses in HIV+ individuals, results suggest that immune protection and vaccine responses may not differ by HIV status.","Pallikkuth, S.; Sharkey, M.; Beauchamps, L.; Raccamarich, P.; Uribe, C.; Salazar, A.; Pallin, M.; Varghese, E.; Roach, M.

"Background: The role that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play in the protection from and disease severity of COVID-19 is not completely understood. A better understanding of T cell function and the epitopes that they target will be invaluable in the development of the next generation of vaccines and therapeutics. To better understand the role of T cells, we characterized the frequency, effector functions and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in a cohort of patients who recovered from COVID-19, and identified multiple peptides that contain T cell epitopes within the Spike protein (S), Nucleocapsid protein (N) and Membrane protein (M). Methods: The frequency and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells from convalescent patients with mild or moderate disease (n=27, 25 to 92 days post-symptom onset) were determined by polychromatic flow cytometry and intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Cells were stimulated for 6 hours with peptide pools corresponding to S, N and M. Cytokine production, memory phenotype, chemokine receptor expression and PD-1 expression were analyzed. For a subset of individuals (n = 19 for S;n=14 for N and M), IFNg ELISpot assays and peptide matrices were utilized to identify peptides that contain T cell epitopes. Results: CD4+ T cell responses to S, N and/or M were detected in almost all donors by ICS and were predominantly a Th1-type response as determined by cytokine production (IFNg, IL-2 or TNF) and expression of CXCR3. A majority of the antigen-specific CD4+ cells were found in the effector memory compartment. Although less robust than the CD4+ T cell response, antigenspecific CD8+ T cells were detected in a majority of donors, were found within the effector memory compartments and displayed modest PD-1 upregulation. Multiple peptides that contain T cell epitopes were identified by IFNg ELISpot (Figure 1). Some of the most commonly identified peptides include S42 (amino acids 165-179;7/19 donors), S205 (a.a. 817-831;10/19 donors), N83 (a.a. 329-343;7/14 donors), M37 (a.a. 145-159;8/14 donors) and M45 (a.a. 177-191;10/14 donors). Conclusion: These data suggest that T cells that target S, N and M play an important role in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and should be considered in future vaccine development. Further studies such as transcriptomic analysis and the TCR usage in longitudinal samples will provide a better understanding of epitope-specific T cells and their longevity.","Boswell, K.

"Background: There is an urgent need to understand the nature of immune responses mounted against SARS-CoV-2, in order to better inform riskmitigation and vaccine strategies for people living with HIV (PLWH). Although not all PLWH are considered immunosuppressed, residual cellular immunodeficiency could influence COVID-19 disease severity and the evolution and durability of protective immunity. Information on the breadth, magnitude and longevity of SARS-CoV-2 specific responses in PLWH recovering from COVID-19 disease is currently lacking. In this study, we performed an integrated cross-sectional analysis of different branches of adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in PLWH and HIV negative donors in the convalescent phase of predominately mild COVID-19 disease. Methods: A total of n=47 HIV positive, controlled on ART, and n=35 HIV negative subjects were recruited at a median of 158 and 146 days post symptom onset respectively. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against Spike (S1) and Nucleoprotein (N) were measured in serum by a Semiquantitative ELISA. A serum neutralisation assay with pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 was performed to calculate the 50% inhibitory serum dilution (ID50). SARS-CoV-2 specific memory T cell responses were determined by IFN-¦Ã ELISpot and intracellular cytokine production assays using peptide pools against SARS-CoV-2 structural and accessory proteins (Spike, Membrane, Nucleocapsid, Envelope, and ORF3a,6,7,8). Results: The majority of PLWH had detectable SARS-CoV-2 S-and N-specific antibodies with neutralizing activity at levels comparable to HIV negative subjects (p= 0.5753). Although, the overall magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses measured by ELISpot was not significantly different between the groups (p=0.4642), this correlated with the size of the na?ve CD4 T cell pool (r=0.5518, p=0.0143) and the CD4:CD8 ratio in PLWH (r= 0.3820, p=0.037). In both groups, SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 T cells were more abundant compared to CD8 T cells (HIV-p= 0.002, HIV+ p=0.0019). Both humoral and cellular responses were detected between 5-7 months post infection, providing evidence of medium-term durability of responses irrespective of HIV serostatus. Conclusion: The majority of PLWH mount a functional adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Incomplete immune reconstitution on ART and persistent alterations in the T cell compartment could, however, impact the development of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2. These findings have implications for the risk stratification and management of PLWH.","Alrubayyi, A.

"OBJECTIVES: To explore rates and factors associated with mandatory vaccination support overall and intentions to get vaccinated specifically for COVID-19 among individuals in Greece. METHODS: Using data from a nationally representative cross-sectional survey conducted in October 2020 among 855 adults (&amp;#8805;18 years) in Greece, we estimated support rates for mandatory vaccination and respondents&#039; intention to get vaccinated for COVID-19 as well as associations thereof with individual sociodemographic, clinical and contextual characteristics. RESULTS: About 74% of respondents supported mandatory vaccination and 62% intended to get vaccinated for COVID-19. The most prevalent reasons against COVID-19 vaccination were safety concerns related to the duration of clinical trials and potential side effects. Individuals who reported increased trust in healthcare authorities&#039; recommendations, who revealed that their trust in the State increased due to the way the COVID-19 pandemic was handled, who used preventive services more often, and those with higher income were more likely to both support mandatory vaccination and to indicate intention to get vaccinated for COVID-19. Participants with worse or better self-reported health status (compared to average), younger adults, and females were less likely to intend to get vaccinated for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The survey revealed that the majority of the Greek citizens favour mandatory vaccination overall and intend to get vaccinated for COVID-19, driven mostly by utilization of preventive services and trust in healthcare authorities. However, intention to get vaccinated for COVID-19 was lower relative to mandatory vaccination support. This suggests a need to intensify evidence-based yet simplified messaging by esteemed healthcare providers to inform the public on the risks and benefits of vaccines.","Giannouchos, Theodoros V; Steletou, Evaggelia; Saridi, Maria; Souliotis, Kyriakos",,MEDLINE,,20210607.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jep.13588,covidwho-1249434,1365-2753,,J. eval. clin. pract.

"BACKGROUND: Serological assays detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are being widely deployed in studies and clinical practice. However, the duration and effectiveness of the protection conferred by the immune response remains to be assessed in population-based samples. To estimate the incidence of newly acquired SARS-CoV-2 infections in seropositive individuals as compared to seronegative controls we conducted a retrospective longitudinal matched study. METHODS: A seroprevalence survey including a representative sample of the population was conducted in Geneva, Switzerland between April and June 2020, immediately after the first pandemic wave. Seropositive participants were matched one-to-two to seronegative controls, using a propensity-score including age, gender, immunodeficiency, BMI, smoking status and education level. Each individual was linked to a state-registry of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our primary outcome was confirmed infections occurring from serological status assessment to the end of the second pandemic wave (January 2021). RESULTS: Among 8344 serosurvey participants, 498 seropositive individuals were selected and matched with 996 seronegative controls. After a mean follow-up of 35.6 (SD 3.2) weeks, 7 out of 498 (1.4%) seropositive subjects had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, of whom 5 (1.0%) were classified as reinfections. In contrast, the infection rate was higher in seronegative individuals (15.5%, 154/996) during a similar follow-up period (mean 34.7 [SD 3.2] weeks), corresponding to a 94% (95%CI 86% to 98%, P&lt;0.001) reduction in the hazard of having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test for seropositives. CONCLUSIONS: Seroconversion after SARS-CoV-2 infection confers protection against reinfection lasting at least 8 months.

"Background: There are several COVID-19 vaccines available and many are under different stages of development. However, vaccine hesitancy, including vaccination delays and refusals, represents a major hurdle for achieving herd immunity. The current study aims to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and the associated factors.Method: This is a cross-sectional survey-based study that was conducted between Aug and Nov 2020.Results: There were 417 respondents with nearly 61% females, more than 65% fall between the ages of 18 and 29?years, three-quarters holding a university degree, with more than 63% identified as single, and those who have no children represented more than 67% of the respondents. More than 36% of the respondents considered themselves COVID-19 vaccine hesitant. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy appeared to be high among female respondents (p =?.02), aged 30?years old and above (p &lt;?.001), widowed or divorced (p &lt;?.001) and those who have a child (p &lt;?.001). One of the most vaccine hesitancy influencing factors is the vaccines&#039; country of origin.Conclusion: There appears to be a high COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the participants with several associated factors.

"Among health care professionals, dentists are more prone to infection due to their direct contact with blood and saliva. This study highlights the level of compliance with infection control measures among dental students; and linked this to their knowledge and attitudes regarding infection control measures and proper vaccinations. The study is a multi-centre analytical cross-sectional survey. The sample size was 969 clinical years&#039; students from governmental and private dental colleges in Sudan and Saudi Arabia. A pre-coded, pre-tested, and anonymous questionnaire consisted of seven categories of knowledge, attitude, awareness, and practices, including 40 questions, was answered. The study has linked knowledge, attitude, and practice in dental clinics with possible COVID-19 transmission in dental clinics. The results showed that the use of some Personal Protective Equipment was low in Sudan and moderate in Saudi Arabia (statistically significant, p &lt; 0.001). Moderate percentage of Hepatitis B vaccination status, with low percentage of Post HBV serology, was reported (p &lt; 0.001).

"The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic and led to nearly three million deaths globally. As of April 2021, there are still many countries that do not have COVID-19 vaccines. Before the COVID-19 vaccines were developed, some evidence suggested that an influenza vaccine may stimulate nonspecific immune responses that reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection or the severity of COVID-19 illness after infection. This study evaluated the association between influenza vaccination and the risk of COVID-19 infection. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study with data from July 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020 with the Claims data from Symphony Health database. The study population was adults age 65 years old or older who received influenza vaccination between September 1 and December 31 of 2019. The main outcomes and measures were odds of COVID-19 infection and severe COVID-19 illness after January 15, 2020. We found the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of COVID-19 infection risk between the influenza-vaccination group and no-influenza-vaccination group was 0.76 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.75-0.77). Among COVID-19 patients, the aOR of developing severe COVID-19 illness was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.68-0.76) between the influenza-vaccination group and the no-influenza-vaccination group. When the influenza-vaccination group and the other-vaccination group were compared, the aOR of COVID-19 infection was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97), and the aOR of developing a severe COVID-19 illness was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.80-1.13).

"OBJECTIVES: Hesitance and resistance to COVID-19 vaccination poses a serious challenge to achieving adequate vaccine uptake in the general population. Cross-sectional data from the early months of the pandemic indicates that approximately one-third of adults in multiple nations are hesitant or resistant to a vaccine for COVID-19. Using longitudinal data, we tracked changes in attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination during the pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: This is a quantitative, longitudinal design. METHOD: Nationally representative samples of the adult general population of the Republic of Ireland (N?=?1041) and the United Kingdom (N?=?2025) were assessed for their attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination at three points from March to August 2020. RESULTS: Statistically significant increases in resistance to COVID-19 vaccination were observed in Irish (from 9.5% to 18.1%) and British (from 6.2% to 10%) adults. CONCLUSION: Resistance to vaccination has significantly increased in two European nations as the pandemic has progressed. Growing resistance to COVID-19 vaccination will pose a challenge to public health officials responsible for ensuring sufficient vaccine coverage.","Hyland, P; Valli¨¨res, F; Shevlin, M; Bentall, R P; McKay, R; Hartman, T K; McBride, O; Murphy, J",,MEDLINE,,20210602.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.04.009,covidwho-1246145,1476-5616,,Public Health,en,NL,2021.0,"Public Health;195: 54-56, 2021 Apr 27.

"Importance: The impact of COVID-19 in the US has been far-reaching and devastating, especially in Black populations. Vaccination is a critical part of controlling community spread, but vaccine acceptance has varied, with some research reporting that Black individuals in the US are less willing to be vaccinated than other racial/ethnic groups. Medical mistrust informed by experiences of racism may be associated with this lower willingness. Objective: To examine the association between race/ethnicity and rejection of COVID-19 vaccine trial participation and vaccine uptake and to investigate whether racial/ethnic group-based medical mistrust is a potential mediator of this association. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional survey study was conducted from June to December 2020 using a convenience sample of 1835 adults aged 18 years or older residing in Michigan. Participants were recruited through community-based organizations and hospital-academic networks. Main Outcomes and Measures: Separate items assessed whether respondents, if asked, would agree to participate in a research study to test a COVID-19 vaccine or to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Participants also completed the suspicion subscale of the Group-Based Medical Mistrust Scale. Results: Of the 1835 participants, 1455 (79%) were women, 361 (20%) men, and 19 (1%) other gender. The mean (SD) age was 49.4 (17.9) years, and 394 participants (21%) identified as Black individuals. Overall, 1376 participants (75%) reported low willingness to participate in vaccine trials, and 945 (52%) reported low willingness to be vaccinated. Black participants reported the highest medical mistrust scores (mean [SD], 2.35 [0.96]) compared with other racial/ethnic groups (mean [SD] for the total sample, 1.83 [0.91]). Analysis of path models revealed significantly greater vaccine trial and vaccine uptake rejection among Black participants (vaccine trial: B [SE], 0.51 [0.08]; vaccine uptake: B [SE], 0.51 [0.08]; both P &lt; .001) compared with the overall mean rejection. The association was partially mediated by medical mistrust among Black participants (vaccine trial: B [SE], 0.04 [0.01]; P = .003; vaccine uptake: B [SE], 0.07 [0.02]; P &lt; .001) and White participants (vaccine trial: B [SE], -0.06 [0.02]; P = .001; vaccine uptake: B [SE], -0.10 [0.02]; P &lt; .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study of US adults, racial/ethnic group-based medical mistrust partially mediated the association between individuals identifying as Black and low rates of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine trial participation and actual vaccination. The findings suggest that partnerships between health care and other sectors to build trust and promote vaccination may benefit from socially and culturally responsive strategies that acknowledge and address racial/ethnic health care disparities and historical and contemporary experiences of racism.","Thompson, Hayley S; Manning, Mark; Mitchell, Jamie; Kim, Seongho; Harper, Felicity W K; Cresswell, Sheena; Johns, Kristopher; Pal, Shoma; Dowe, Brittany; Tariq, Madiha; Sayed, Nadia; Saigh, Lisa M; Rutledge, Lisa; Lipscomb, Curtis; Lilly, Jametta Y; Gustine, Heidi; Sanders, Annie; Landry, Megan; Marks, Bertram",,MEDLINE,COVID-19 Vaccines/therapeutic use; COVID-19/ethnology; Clinical Trials as Topic/psychology; Continental Population Groups/psychology; Trust; Vaccination Refusal/ethnology; Adolescent; Adult; African Americans/psychology; African Americans/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Aged; Asian Americans/psychology; Asian Americans/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Attitude to Health/ethnology; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Continental Population Groups/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Cross-Sectional Studies; European Continental Ancestry Group/psychology; European Continental Ancestry Group/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Female; Hispanic Americans/psychology; Hispanic Americans/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Humans; Male; Michigan; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/ethnology; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/psychology; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Trust/psychology; Vaccination Refusal/psychology; Vaccination Refusal/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Young Adult,20210602.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.11629,covidwho-1245327,2574-3805,5,JAMA Netw Open,en,US,2021.0,"JAMA Netw Open;4(5): e2111629, 2021 05 03.

"On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of lower respiratory infections was documented in Wuhan caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the beginning, SARS-CoV-2 has caused many infections among healthcare workers (HCWs) worldwide. Aims of this study were: a. to compare the distribution among the HCWs and the general population of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Western Sicily and Italy; b. to describe the characteristics of HCWs infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the western Sicilian healthcare context during the first wave of the epidemic diffusion in Italy. Incidence and mean age of HCWs infected with SARS-CoV-2 were comparable in Western Sicily and in the whole Italian country. The 97.6% of infections occurred in HCWs operating in non-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) working environments, while an equal distribution of cases between hospital and primary care services context was documented. Nurses and healthcare assistants, followed by physicians, were the categories more frequently infected by SARS-CoV-2. The present study suggests that healthcare workers are easily infected compared to the general population but that often infection could equally occur in hospital and non-hospital settings. Safety of HCWs in counteracting the COVID-19 pandemic must be strengthened in hospital [adequate provision of personal protective equipment (PPE), optimization of human resources, implementation of closed and independent groups of HCWs, creation of traffic control building and dedicated areas in every healthcare context] and non-hospital settings (influenza vaccination, adequate psychophysical support, including refreshments during working shifts, adequate rest, and family support).","Costantino, Claudio; Cannizzaro, Emanuele; Verso, Maria Gabriella; Tramuto, Fabio; Maida, Carmelo Massimo; Lacca, Guido; Alba, Davide; Cimino, Livia; Conforto, Arianna; Cirrincione, Luigi; Graziano, Giorgio; Palmeri, Sara; Pizzo, Stefano; Restivo, Vincenzo; Casuccio, Alessandra; Vitale, Francesco; Mazzucco, Walter",,MEDLINE,COVID-19; Pandemics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delivery of Health Care; Health Personnel; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Sicily/epidemiology,20210602.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.644008,covidwho-1247942,2296-2565,,Front Public Health,en,CH,2021.0,"Front Public Health;9: 644008, 2021.

"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus pandemic in Wuhan, China, since December 2019 has been the major public health concern. With the absence of an effective vaccine or treatment for the disease, current control measures are directed toward preventive measures to lessen disease burden and to curb the spread of the virus. AIM: The aim of the study was to assess knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and practices (KAPP) of adult Egyptians toward COVID-19 and to study their determinants. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional survey of a random sample of 999 Egyptian residence aged 16 years and above, it was conducted between April and June 2020 using self-administrated online questionnaire. It consisted of 15, five, and eight questions pertaining to knowledge, attitude, and practices toward COVID-19, respectively, in addition to demographic data. Data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 23.0 at a level of significant at p ¡Ü 0.05. RESULTS: Out of the 999 participants, 628 (62.8%) were aged (20-&amp;lt;40y), 666 (66.7%) were females 576 (57.6) from urban residence, 665 (66.7%) were married with university educated or higher 605 (60.5%), and only 105 (10.5%) had chronic diseases. The total knowledge score was significantly higher among highly educated, females, in rural areas, married, and governmental workers, while higher educational status, females, married, smokers, and being without chronic diseases and governmental workers were significantly associated with higher practice scores. CONCLUSIONS: Egyptian participates had good level of knowledge, positive attitude about COVID-19 infection and, poor practice;however, community educational campaigns are necessary to ensure to improve on practice campaigns. ? 2021 Doaa I.

"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 was first detected in Lebanon on February 21, 2020; it reached its peak in January 2021, with a total number of 418,448 confirmed cases and 5380 deaths (until March 15, 2021). Gaining insight into factors regarding willingness or refusal for vaccination might guide our goals in raising the awareness and target efforts to increase acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine and maximize the uptake. Therefore, this study aims to assess the intent to receive the COVID-19 vaccine among Lebanese adults and the factors associated with vaccine refusal. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study during November-December 2020 among Lebanese adults from all Lebanese regions using a survey tool with closed-ended questions that included sociodemographic data and questions about vaccine hesitancy, knowledge, attitude, practice, and fear of COVID-19. We used the snowball technique to collect the data because of the COVID-19 imposed lockdown. RESULTS: Of the 579 participants, 21.4% were willing to receive the vaccine, 40.9% refused, and the remainder were unsure of their response. More vaccine hesitancy (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.06; 95% CI 1.03-1.09) was significantly associated with more odds of disagreeing/ strongly disagreeing on receiving the COVID-19 vaccine compared to being neutral. More vaccine hesitancy (aOR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.91-0.99), female gender compared to males (aOR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.32-0.87), and being married compared to single (aOR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.29-0.98) were significantly associated with lower odds of agreeing/strongly agreeing on receiving the COVID-19 vaccine compared to being neutral. CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings revealed a high percentage of people (40%) who strongly disagreed with receiving the vaccine, mainly females, married participants, and those who have a general vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, no significant association was found with knowledge, attitude, or prevention practice regarding COVID-19. Targeted efforts are necessary to increase acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine among the Lebanese population to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Further studies with a larger sample size are warranted to validate our results and provide better insights into the underlying reasons for refusing vaccination.","Kasrine Al Halabi, Carina; Obeid, Sahar; Sacre, Hala; Akel, Marwan; Hallit, Rabih; Salameh, Pascale; Hallit, Souheil",,MEDLINE,COVID-19 Vaccines; COVID-19; Adult; Attitude; Communicable Disease Control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Lebanon; Male; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination,20210601.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10902-w,covidwho-1244916,1471-2458,1,BMC Public Health,en,GB,2021.0,"BMC Public Health;21(1): 998, 2021 05 27.

"Background: Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic, there was no doubt that vaccination is the ideal protocol to tackle it. Within a year, a few COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and authorized. This unparalleled initiative in developing vaccines created many uncertainties looming around the efficacy and safety of these vaccines. This study aimed to assess the side effects and perceptions following COVID-19 vaccination in Jordan. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted by distributing an online survey targeted toward Jordan inhabitants who received any COVID-19 vaccines. Data were statistically analyzed and certain machine learning (ML) tools, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and K-star were used to predict the severity of side effects. Results: A total of 2213 participants were involved in the study after receiving Sinopharm, AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, and other vaccines (38.2%, 31%, 27.3%, and 3.5%, respectively). Generally, most of the post-vaccination side effects were common and non-life-threatening (e.g., fatigue, chills, dizziness, fever, headache, joint pain, and myalgia). Only 10% of participants suffered from severe side effects;while 39% and 21% of participants had moderate and mild side effects, respectively. Despite the substantial variations between these vaccines in the presence and severity of side effects, the statistical analysis indicated that these vaccines might provide the same protection against COVID-19 infection. Finally, around 52.9% of participants suffered before vaccination from vaccine hesitancy and anxiety;while after vaccination, 95.5% of participants have advised others to get vaccinated, 80% felt more reassured, and 67% believed that COVID-19 vaccines are safe in the long term. Furthermore, based on the type of vaccine, demographic data, and side effects, the RF, XGBoost, and MLP gave both high accuracies (0.80, 0.79, and 0.70, respectively) and Cohen¡¯s kappa values (0.71, 0.70, and 0.56, respectively). Conclusions: The present study confirmed that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and getting vaccinated makes people more reassured. Most of the post-vaccination side effects are mild to moderate, which are signs that body¡¯s immune system is building protection. ML can also be used to predict the severity of side effects based on the input data;predicted severe cases may require more medical attention or even hospitalization.","Hatmal, Ma¡¯mon M.; Al-Hatamleh, Mohammad A.

"Saliva omics has immense potential for non-invasive diagnostics, including monitoring very young or elderly populations, or individuals in remote locations. In this study, multiple saliva omics from an individual were monitored over three periods (100 timepoints) involving: (1) hourly sampling over 24 h without intervention, (2) hourly sampling over 24 h including immune system activation using the standard 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, (3) daily sampling for 33 days profiling the post-vaccination response. At each timepoint total saliva transcriptome and proteome, and small RNA from salivary extracellular vesicles were profiled, including mRNA, miRNA, piRNA and bacterial RNA. The two 24-h periods were used in a paired analysis to remove daily variation and reveal vaccination responses. Over 18,000 omics longitudinal series had statistically significant temporal trends compared to a healthy baseline. Various immune response and regulation pathways were activated following vaccination, including interferon and cytokine signaling, and MHC antigen presentation. Immune response timeframes were concordant with innate and adaptive immunity development, and coincided with vaccination and reported fever. Overall, mRNA results appeared more specific and sensitive (timewise) to vaccination compared to other omics. The results suggest saliva omics can be consistently assessed for non-invasive personalized monitoring and immune response diagnostics.","Mias, George I; Singh, Vikas Vikram; Rogers, Lavida R K; Xue, Shuyue; Zheng, Minzhang; Domanskyi, Sergii; Kanada, Masamitsu; Piermarocchi, Carlo; He, Jin",,MEDLINE,,20210527.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-80605-6,covidwho-1242036,2045-2322,1,Sci Rep,en,GB,2021.0,"Sci Rep;11(1): 710, 2021 Jan 12.

The countrywide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic had halted the accessibility to cervical cancer screening programme. The aim of the study is to determine the feasibility of providing primary HPV DNA test using the selfsampling method to the hard-to-reach population in the interior of Sarawak during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study where women aged between 20-80 years were recruited via convenient sampling from villages in Long Banga, Sarawak over a five-day outreach programme. Cervicovaginal selfsamples were obtained and screened for the presence of high-risk human papillomavirus DNA (HR-HPV) using the careHPVTM Test. A self-administered questionnaire was also administered to determine the sociodemographic and perception towards the self-sampling method. RESULTS: The 55 women recruited consist of ethnic backgrounds of Penan (58.18%), Kenyah (25.45%), Iban (5.45%), Saban (3.64%), Kelabit (3.64%), Malay (1.82%) and Chinese (1.82%). The prevalence of HR-HPV was 1.85% (n=1/55). Nearly 80% of the women were unemployed, and more than half have had attended primary education. Nine (16.4%) have heard about HPV, and seven (13%) knew HPV infection could cause cervical cancer. Three of them had HPV vaccination, and only one (1.85%) knew the brand of the HPV vaccine. Although 40% preferred self-sampling over clinician-collection, only ten (18.2%) women have completed the self-collection perception questionnaire. CONCLUSION: Primary HPV DNA screening using the selfsampling method can be carried out in the remote areas during the COVID-19 pandemic without compromising mobility restriction.","Tan, C.

"BACKGROUND: The success of vaccination efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic will require broad public uptake of immunization and highlights the importance of understanding factors associated with willingness to receive a vaccine. METHODS: U.S. adults aged 65 and older enrolled in the HeartlineTM clinical study were invited to complete a COVID-19 vaccine assessment through the HeartlineTM mobile application between November 6-20, 2020. Factors associated with willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine were evaluated using an ordered logistic regression as well as a Random Forest classification algorithm. RESULTS: Among 9,106 study participants, 81.3% (n = 7402) responded and had available demographic data. The majority (91.3%) reported a willingness to be vaccinated. Factors most strongly associated with vaccine willingness were beliefs about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines in general. Women and Black or African American respondents reported lower willingness to vaccinate. Among those less willing to get vaccinated, 66.2% said that they would talk with their health provider before making a decision. During the study, positive results from the first COVID-19 vaccine outcome study were released; vaccine willingness increased after this report. CONCLUSIONS: Even among older adults at high-risk for COVID-19 complications who are participating in a longitudinal clinical study, 1 in 11 reported lack of willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine in November 2020. Variability in vaccine willingness by gender, race, education, and income suggests the potential for uneven vaccine uptake. Education by health providers directed toward assuaging concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy can help improve vaccine acceptance among those less willing.

"BACKGROUND: There has been a recent recognized shift towards a whole-of-life or life-course approach to immunisation. However, coverage amongst at-risk adults for recommended vaccines continues to be suboptimal. This study examined the perceptions of middle and older aged Australian adults towards hospital-based immunization programs and their previous exposures to receiving vaccines via tertiary care. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with Australian adults 45?years and older in late 2019 to capture influenza and pneumococcal vaccine uptake, exposure to hospital-based immunization programs, missed opportunities to vaccinate and receptiveness towards the promotion and/or delivery of vaccines in the hospital setting. RESULTS: Only 13 respondents reported receiving a vaccine at hospital, yet 72.2% (931/1292) indicated that they were willing to be vaccinated in that setting. Amongst those who attended hospital during 2019 and were eligible for vaccination, 57.2% and 28.3% of respondents were not immunized for pneumococcal and influenza, respectively. Missed opportunities for both vaccines were significantly higher amongst those at low-risk for influenza (&amp;#8804;65?years (low-risk): 52.9%, &amp;#8804;65?years (high-risk): 18.3%, &gt;65?years: 15.1%; p?&lt;?0.001) and pneumococcal (&amp;#8804;65?years (low-risk): 79.1%, &amp;#8804;65?years (high-risk): 52.4%, &gt;65?years: 44%; p?&lt;?0.001). Among those with a missed opportunity for hospital-based vaccination, the most common reason for not getting immunized was a lack of recommendation. Most (86.4%) reported that their general practitioner was the person or group they trusted most to receive vaccine information from. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this Australian study support international work that shows very low rates of opportunistic vaccination in hospitals despite national recommendations to vaccinate prior to discharge. Considering the need for high levels of uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine, hospitals may need to be considered to opportunistically capture those not accessing the vaccine in other settings.","McFadden, Kathleen; Heywood, Anita; Dyda, Amalie; Kaufman, Jessica; Seale, Holly",,MEDLINE,COVID-19; Influenza Vaccines; Adult; Aged; Australia; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hospitals; Humans; Immunization; Immunization Programs; Middle Aged; Pneumococcal Vaccines; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination,20210526.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.05.027,covidwho-1240641,1873-2518,26,Vaccine,en,NL,2021.0,"Vaccine;39(26): 3467-3472, 2021 06 11.

"Objective: Background The purpose of the study was to evaluate regional related differences in Latin America on the impact of the pandemic in cardiometabolic patients without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted which included 38 questions about demography, clinical condition, change of health habits, medical treatments to cardio metabolic patients in outpatient follow-up. A total of 66 researchers from 13 Latin American countries enrolled patients from June 15 to July 15, 2020. The countries were divided into 3 geographic regions Region1 (NCCR) North, Central, and Caribbean Region;Region2 (AR) Andean Region;Region3 (SCR) Southern Cone Region. Isolation measures were estimated from national reports and correlated using the Spearman R coefficient. Design and method: 4216 patients were analyzed, NCCR (33.82%);AR (32.23%) SCR (33.94%). Significant differences were found between regions in the AR, SCR and NCCR, in age, unemployment, CV risk, adherence, percentage of smokers, type of diet and vaccination coverage. This analysis of habitual medication showed, that discontinued medication was greater in AR, reaching almost 30% (1 in 3 patients), to a lesser extent in NCCR and ultimately less in SCR, showing a significant difference between zones (p &amp;lt;0.001). The main finding of this study was the negative impact that restrictive measures have on adherence to medications and physical activity, Rs = 0.84 p=0.0003 and Rs=0.61 p= 0.0032, respectively. Results: Significant differences were found between regions, AR is the most vulnerable region, lower income, lower educational level, higher medication discontinuation. Restrictive measures imposed by the different countries (quarantine) showed a positive correlation with the discontinuation of medication and a negative correlation with the amount of physical activity. The impact of the consequences left by this pandemic will be very profound in most Latin American countries.","Camilletti, J.; Renna, N.; Santi, R. L.; Erriest, J.; Siller, G. P.; Garcia, M.

"Objective: The study objectives are to assess the challenges faced, individual awareness of pandemic, attitudes, and compliance of guidelines during lockdown. Design and method: This telephonic survey of 404 adult individuals were administered among hypertensive population with and without comorbidities of a longitudinal cohort in Barrackpore, West Bengal, India in Aug-Sept&#039;2020. Comorbidities comprised with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, asthma, OSA, BMI, epilepsy, stroke, arthritis, and cancer. Convenience sampling was considered to outline socio-demographics;chronic illness status;knowledge, attitude and practices;mood changes;and difficulties faced during lockdown. Association between variables have been conformed through multivariate logistic regression. Results: A total of 404 respondents, lone hypertensive 6.4%, hypertensive with other comorbidities 93.6%.

"BACKGROUND: Acceptance of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is critical to achieving high levels of immunization. The objectives of this study were to understand mothers&#039; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine intentions to explore reasons for and against SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. METHODS: Participants from the All Our Families pregnancy longitudinal cohort whose children had reached ages 9-12 years were invited in May-June 2020 to complete a survey on the impact of COVID-19. The survey covered topics about the impact of the pandemic and included 2 specific questions on mothers&#039; intentions to vaccinate their child against SARS-CoV-2. Current responses were linked to previously collected data, including infant vaccine uptake. Multinomial regression models were run to estimate associations between demographic factors, past vaccination status and vaccination intention. Qualitative responses regarding factors affecting decision-making were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: The response rate was 53.8% (1321/2455). A minority of children of participants had partial or no vaccinations at age 2 (n = 200, 15.1%). A total of 60.4% of mothers (n = 798) intended to vaccinate their children with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, 8.6% (n = 113) did not intend to vaccinate and 31.0% (n = 410) were unsure. Lower education, lower income and incomplete vaccination history were inversely associated with intention to vaccinate. Thematic analysis of qualitative responses showed 10 themes, including safety and efficacy, long-term effects and a rushed process. INTERPRETATION: Within a cohort with historically high infant vaccination, a third of mothers remained unsure about vaccinating their children against SARS-CoV-2. Given the many uncertainties about future SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, clear communication regarding safety will be critical to ensuring vaccine uptake.","Hetherington, Erin; Edwards, Sarah A; MacDonald, Shannon E; Racine, Nicole; Madigan, Sheri; McDonald, Sheila; Tough, Suzanne",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19 Vaccines/therapeutic use; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Intention; Mothers/psychology; Vaccination/psychology; Adult; Age Factors; COVID-19 Vaccines/adverse effects; Canada; Child; Educational Status; Ethnic Groups; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Surveys; Humans; Income; Marital Status; Middle Aged; Regression Analysis; SARS-CoV-2",20210525.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.9778/cmajo.20200302,covidwho-1239170,2291-0026,2,CMAJ Open,en,CA,2021.0,"CMAJ Open;9(2): E548-E555, 2021.

"OBJECTIVE: This study describes the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy associated with the Catalan systematic childhood vaccination calendar and some related psychosocial determinants among paediatric primary care nurses in Barcelona (Spain). METHODS: Cross-sectional descriptive study. In 2017 we invited the paediatric nurses (N = 165) working in Barcelona public primary health centres with paediatric departments (N = 41) to participate. They answered a questionnaire with sociodemographic and behavioural variables: severity and perceived probability of contracting the diseases of the vaccines in the vaccination schedule; safety and protection offered by each vaccine; and beliefs, social norms, and knowledge about vaccines. Outcome variable was vaccine hesitancy, dichotomized into not hesitant (nurses who would vaccinate their own offspring), and hesitant (including those who would not vaccinate them, those who had doubts and those who would delay the administration of one or more vaccines). We performed bivariate analysis and adjusted logistic regression models. RESULTS: 83% of paediatric nurses (N = 137) agreed to participate. 67.9% had the intention to vaccinate their children of all the vaccines in the systematic schedule. 32.1% of nurses experienced vaccine hesitancy, especially about the HPV (21.9%) and varicella (17.5%) vaccines. The multivariate analysis suggests associations between hesitancy and low perception of the severity of whooping cough (aOR: 3.88; 95%CI:1.32-11.4), low perception of safety of the HPV vaccine (aOR:8.5;95%CI:1.24-57.8), the belief that vaccines are administered too early (aOR:6.09;95%CI:1.98-18.8), and not having children (aOR:4.05;95%CI:1.22-13.3). CONCLUSIONS: Although most paediatric nurses had the intention to vaccinate their own children, almost one-third reported some kind of vaccine hesitancy, mainly related to doubts about HPV and varicella vaccines, as well as some misconceptions. These factors should be addressed to enhance nurses&#039; fundamental role in promoting vaccination to families.","Elizondo-Alzola, Usue; G Carrasco, Mireia; Pin¨®s, Laia; Picchio, Camila Andrea; Rius, Cristina; Diez, Elia",,MEDLINE,,20210525.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251735,covidwho-1238768,1932-6203,5,PLoS One,en,US,2021.0,"PLoS One;16(5): e0251735, 2021.

"BACKGROUND: This study determined the knowledge, attitudes, and practice regarding COVID-19 and assessed the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among healthcare workers and the general population. METHODS: A web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted using convenience sampling in Libya from December 1 to 18, 2020 among the general population and healthcare workers. Data on demographic characteristics, COVID-19 vaccination-related concerns, knowledge, attitudes, and practice regarding COVID-19, and knowledge, attitudes, and acceptance regarding the COVID-19 vaccine were collected using a self-administered survey. A binomial logistic regression was performed with 70% efficacy to determine the association between acceptance of the vaccine and study variables. RESULTS: Valid and complete responses were collected from 15,087 participants. Of these, 6227 (41.3%) were male and 8860 (58.7%) were female, with a mean (SD) age of 30.6 ¡À 9.8 years. Moreover, 485 (3.2%) participants were infected with COVID-19 at the time of the study, while 2000 (13.3%) had been previously infected. Overall, 2452 (16.3%) participants agreed, and 3127 (20.7%) strongly agreed, with &quot;having concerns about serious vaccine-related complications.&quot; Mask-wearing adherence was reported by 10,268 (68.1%) of the participants. Most participants (14,050, 93.1%) believed that the vaccine should be provided for free, while 7272 (48.2%) were willing to buy it. Regarding vaccine acceptance and efficacy, 12,006 (79.6%) reported their willingness to take the vaccine with an efficacy of 90% or more, 9143 (60.6%) with an efficacy of 70% or more, and only 6212 (41.2%) with an efficacy of 50%. The binomial logistic regression revealed that vaccine acceptance was not associated with belonging to the medical field versus the general population. Acceptance was statistically associated with younger age groups, especially 31-40 (OR = 1.3 [1.09, 1.55]) and 41-50 years (OR = 1.29, [1.09, 1.54]). However, having a family member or friend infected with COVID-19 was positively associated with the likelihood of vaccine acceptance (OR = 1.09 [1.02, 1.18]), while having a friend or family member who died due to COVID-19 was negatively associated with it (OR = 0.89 [0.84, 0.97]). CONCLUSIONS: Acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine is an essential determinant of vaccine uptake and the likelihood of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Developing strategies to decrease public hesitation and increase trust is vital for implementing vaccination programs.","Elhadi, Muhammed; Alsoufi, Ahmed; Alhadi, Abdulmueti; Hmeida, Amel; Alshareea, Entisar; Dokali, Mawadda; Abodabos, Sanabel; Alsadiq, Omaymah; Abdelkabir, Mohammed; Ashini, Aimen; Shaban, Abdulhamid; Mohammed, Saja; Alghudban, Nehal; Bureziza, Eman; Najah, Qasi; Abdulrahman, Khawla; Mshareb, Nora; Derwish, Khawla; Shnfier, Najwa; Burkan, Rayan; Al-Azomi, Marwa; Hamdan, Ayman; Algathafi, Khadeejah; Abdulwahed, Eman; Alheerish, Khadeejah; Lindi, Naeimah; Anaiba, Mohamed; Elbarouni, Abobaker; Alsharif, Monther; Alhaddad, Kamal; Alwhishi, Enas; Aboughuffah, Muad; Aljadidi, Wesal; Jaafari, Aisha; Khaled, Ala; Zaid, Ahmed; Msherghi, Ahmed",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19 Vaccines; COVID-19; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Humans; Libya; Male; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",20210525.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10987-3,covidwho-1238715,1471-2458,1,BMC Public Health,en,GB,2021.0,"BMC Public Health;21(1): 955, 2021 05 20.

"BACKGROUND: One of the newly faced challenges during the COVID-19 is vaccine hesitancy (VH). The validated 5C scale, that assesses 5 psychological antecedents of vaccination, could be effective in exploring COVID-19 VH. This study aimed to determine a statistically valid cutoff points for the 5C sub-scales among the Arab population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 446 subjects from 3 Arab countries (Egypt, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Jordan). Information regarding sociodemographics, clinical history, COVID-19 infection and vaccination history, and 5C scale were collected online. The 5C scores were analyzed to define the cutoff points using the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and to verify the capability of the questionnaire to differentiate whether responders are hesitant or non-hesitant to accept vaccination. ROC curve analysis was conducted for previous vaccine administration as a response, with the predictors being the main 5 domains of the 5C questionnaire. The mean score of each sub-scale was compared with COVID-19 vaccine intake. RESULTS: The mean age of the studied population was 37 ¡À 11, 42.9% were males, 44.8% from Egypt, 21.1% from Jordan, and 33.6% from the UAE. Statistically significant differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants, respectively, were detected in the median score of confidence [6.0(1.3) versus 4.7(2.0)], complacency [(2.7(2.0) versus 3.0(2.0)], constraints [1.7(1.7) versus 3.7(2.3)], and collective responsibility [6.7(1.7) versus 5.7(1.7)].

"AIM: This study examined the influence of pandemic fatigue on clinical nurses&#039; mental health, sleep quality and job contentment, with resilience as a mediator. BACKGROUND: Pandemic fatigue is an emerging health concern among frontline clinical nurses as a consequence of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the various measures implemented to slow the spread of infection. As yet, no studies have investigated the link between pandemic fatigue and resilience, mental health, sleep quality and job contentment in frontline clinical nurses. METHODS: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study involving 255 frontline clinical nurses in the Philippines. The Pandemic Fatigue Questionnaire, Brief Resilience Scale, Job Contentment Scale and the Sleep Quality Scale were used to collect data through an online survey. RESULTS: The mean pandemic fatigue score was 3.086 (out of 5). Being vaccinated (??=?0.231, p?&lt;?.001) and increased staffing levels (??=?-0.488, p?&lt;?.01) were associated with decreased pandemic fatigue in clinical nurses. Resilience partially mediated the relationships between (a) pandemic fatigue and mental health (??=?-0.488, p?&lt;?.001), (b) pandemic fatigue and sleep quality (??=?-0.326, p?&lt;?.001) and (c) pandemic fatigue and job contentment (??=?-0.395, p?&lt;?.001). CONCLUSION: Clinical nurses who received a COVID-19 vaccine and those who perceived sufficient staffing in their units reported lower levels of pandemic fatigue. Resilience reduces the effects of pandemic fatigue on clinical nurses&#039; mental health, sleep quality and job contentment. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: By providing frontline nurses with access to COVID-19 vaccines and ensuring sufficient staffing levels, nurse managers could effectively reduce or prevent pandemic fatigue and improve their mental health. Implementing resilience-promoting measures are essential to support nurses&#039; mental health, promote their sleep quality and foster job satisfaction.","Labrague, Leodoro J",,MEDLINE,,20210525.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13383,covidwho-1238448,1365-2834,,J. nurs. manag,en,GB,2021.0,J Nurs Manag;2021 May 21. ,"Pandemic fatigue and clinical nurses&#039; mental health, sleep quality and job contentment during the covid-19 pandemic: The mediating role of resilience.",article,,,
"Quantitation of antibodies to the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2? (SARS-CoV-2) was performed for the detection of adaptive immune response in healthcare workers (HCWs) vaccinated with CorovaVac. We prospectively recruited HCWs from a university hospital in Turkey. Serum samples from 1072 HCWs were obtained following 28 days of the first, and 21 days of the second dose. Detection and quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 antispike antibodies were performed by the chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant; Abbott). Results greater than or equal to the cutoff value 50.0 AU/ml were reported as positive. After the first dose, antispike antibodies were detected in 834 of 1072 (77.8%) HCWs. Seropositivity was higher among females (84.6%) than males (70.6%) (p &lt; 0.001) and was found to be highest in both women and men between the ages of 18-34. After the second dose, antibodies were detected in 1008 of 1012 (99.6%) HCWs. Antibody titers were significantly higher in those who had coronavirus disease-2019 before vaccination than those who did not (p &lt; 0.001). Antibody positivity and median antibody titers were significantly less in HCWs with chronic diseases compared to those without (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, our findings indicated that a relatively high frequency (99.6%) of humoral immunity was produced in HCWs aged 18-59 after two doses of CoronaVac.

"The current study examines differences between COVID-19 vaccine intention and delay. A survey was administered to 585 US respondents in late November 2020 as part of an online longitudinal study. Respondents provided information on whether they would obtain a COVID-19 vaccine, once available, and how long they intended to wait before obtaining it. In the negative intention group, 3.4% reported waiting a few weeks, 34.0% waiting a few months, and 62.6% never getting vaccinated. In multivariable models, social norms were a significant and independent predictor of all vaccine delay and intention models. Vaccine delay was associated with low levels of worry about becoming infected with COVID-19, political conservatism, concerns about vaccine side effects, and low levels of believing a vaccine would be effective. Negative vaccine intentions were associated with worries about becoming infected with COVID-19, concerns about vaccine side effects, beliefs that the vaccines were developed too quickly, and low endorsement of the altruistic belief that older people should have vaccination priority. The study results highlight the importance of a multifactorial approach to assessing vaccine attitudes. The findings suggest that uptake programs should focus on enhancing pro-vaccine norms.","Latkin, Carl; Dayton, Lauren; Yi, Grace; Jaleel, Afareen; Nwosu, Chikaodinaka; Limaye, Rupali",,MEDLINE,,20210524.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1917234,covidwho-1236181,2164-554X,,Hum Vaccin Immunother,en,US,2021.0,"Hum Vaccin Immunother;: 1-11, 2021 May 20.

"Background: Vaccination is one of the best ways to control a pandemic such as COVID-19. However, identifying community apprehensions towards vaccination needs to be understood in detail. This study aims to determine the factors that can predict the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: A cross-sectional study was considered by systematic random sampling of 425 adults with chronic illnesses in Ho Chi Minh City. Data were collected between December 2020 and January 2021 via a self-administered, structured questionnaire. The main outcome was the acceptance of future COVID-19 vaccinations. Results: A total of 425 eligible adults responded to the survey, whose mean age was 52.9+/-15.6 years;67.8% of them were women, more than a half of them had high school education level or higher (57.4%) and received COVID-19 information mainly via television and social media accounted for 82.4% and 58.1%, respectively. Overall, knowledge of COVID-19 was reported as relatively good, with a mean score of 7.11 +/- 1.77 (0-9). Determinants of vaccination acceptance were knowledge and cues to action. Accordingly, there was a 1.2-fold increase in the odds of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination for a 1-unit increase in &quot;the total knowledge score&quot; (AOR 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1-1.3, p&amp;lt;0.05), and there was a 3.2-fold increase in the odds of vaccination acceptance for a 1-unit increase in &quot;cues to action&quot; (AOR 3.2, 95% CI: 1.7-5.8, p&amp;lt;0.001). Conclusion: Determinants that influence the intention to have the COVID-19 vaccination are identified, which can be applied to future health education interventions that should focus on enhanced knowledge towards COVID-19 via mass media messages and cues to action from healthcare workers&#039; recommendations to promote vaccine acceptance.","Huynh, G.; Nguyen, T.

"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic introduced a set of mitigation measures based on personal behavior and attitudes. In the absence of vaccination or specific treatment, it became essential to comply with these measures to reduce infection transmission. Health literacy is the basis for changing behaviors. AIM: To characterize the impact of literacy on knowledge and attitudes towards preventive strategies against COVID-19. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved an online questionnaire applied to students of the University of Porto, Portugal, containing questions about knowledge and attitudes towards COVID-19 based on European guidelines. Health literacy was assessed through the Newest Vital Sign questionnaire. Logistic regression estimated the relationship between health literacy and both knowledge and attitudes. RESULTS: We included 871 participants (76.3% female), with a median age of 22 years old. We found adequate literacy in 92% of our sample, irrespective of gender and age. In the global analysis, 78.6% of the participants had adequate knowledge, and 90.4% had adequate attitudes. We found that better literacy was significantly associated with attitudes towards COVID-19, but not with better knowledge. In a model adjusted for gender, age, and previous education in the health field, female gender and previous education in the health field were associated with better knowledge and attitudes. CONCLUSION: Better health literacy is associated with better attitudes towards preventive strategies against COVID-19. We should invest in ways to improve health literacy, so we can improve people&#039;s attitudes and consequently reduce coronavirus&#039; transmission.","Silva, Maria Jo?o; Santos, Paulo",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19; Health Literacy; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Portugal; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",20210521.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18105421,covidwho-1234737,1660-4601,10,Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),en,CH,2021.0,Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(10)2021 05 19. ,The Impact of Health Literacy on Knowledge and Attitudes towards Preventive Strategies against COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Study.,article,,,18
"Vaccine hesitancy has increased in the past few years, influenced by the socio-cultural differences, political populism, or concerns related to the effectiveness and safety of some vaccines, resulting a feeling of distrust. This feeling can become a barrier against the achievement of the immunity necessary to stop the expansion of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptance of the vaccine against COVID-19 in Spain, as well as to identify the factors that have an influence on the concerns and attitudes of people against accepting the vaccine in the months prior to the start of vaccination on December 2020. An online questionnaire was created to obtain information about (1) sociodemographic characteristics; (2) concerns and sources of information about vaccines; and (3) attitudes about vaccination and state of health. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the influencing factors. Of the 2501 participants, 1207 (48.3%) would accept the COVID-19 vaccine, 623 (24.9%) were hesitant, and 671 (26.8%) would reject it. The logistic regression showed that being male, older than 60, married, retired, with a high level of education, or with a leftist political inclination, could increase the probability of accepting the COVID-19 vaccine. Disinformation and the lack of political consensus were the main sources of distrust. The patients with hypertension, immunodepression, hypercholesterolemia, or respiratory disease, or were overweight, showed a greater acceptance to the vaccine, while those with cancer took the longest to accept it. A low acceptance of the vaccine against COVID-19 was observed among the Spanish population in the phase prior to its availability, and the main fears of the population were identified. It is necessary to offer correct and transparent information about these vaccines to reduce the concerns and increase the trust of the population, to thereby guarantee the success of the vaccination campaigns.","Rodr¨ªguez-Blanco, Noelia; Montero-Navarro, Sergio; Botella-Rico, Jos¨¦ M; Felipe-G¨®mez, Antonio J; S¨¢nchez-M¨¢s, Jes¨²s; Tuells, Jos¨¦",,MEDLINE,COVID-19 Vaccines; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Male; SARS-CoV-2; Spain; Vaccination,20210521.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18105272,covidwho-1234714,1660-4601,10,Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),en,CH,2021.0,Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(10)2021 May 15. ,Willingness to Be Vaccinated against COVID-19 in Spain before the Start of Vaccination: A Cross-Sectional Study.,article,,,18
"BACKGROUND: In Sweden, social restrictions to contain SARS-CoV-2 have primarily relied upon voluntary adherence to a set of recommendations. Strict lockdowns have not been enforced, potentially affecting viral dissemination. To understand the levels of past SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Stockholm population before the start of mass vaccinations, healthy blood donors and pregnant women (n?=?5,100) were sampled at random between 14 March 2020 and 28 February 2021. METHODS: In this cross-sectional prospective study, otherwise-healthy blood donors (n?=?2,600) and pregnant women (n?=?2,500) were sampled for consecutive weeks (at four intervals) throughout the study period. Sera from all participants and a cohort of historical (negative) controls (n?=?595) were screened for IgG responses against stabilized trimers of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein and the smaller receptor-binding domain (RBD). As a complement to standard analytical approaches, a probabilistic (cut-off independent) Bayesian framework that assigns likelihood of past infection was used to analyse data over time. SETTING: Healthy participant samples were randomly selected from their respective pools through Karolinska University Hospital. The study was carried out in accordance with Swedish Ethical Review Authority: registration number 2020-01807. PARTICIPANTS: No participants were symptomatic at sampling, and blood donors were all over the age of 18. No additional metadata were available from the participants. RESULTS: Blood donors and pregnant women showed a similar seroprevalence. After a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased steadily in approach to the winter second wave of infections, approaching 15% of all individuals surveyed by 13 December 2020. By the end of February 2021, 19% of the population tested seropositive. Notably, 96% of seropositive healthy donors screened (n?=?56) developed neutralizing antibody responses at titres comparable to or higher than those observed in clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccination, supporting that mild infection engenders a competent B-cell response. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that in the first year since the start of community transmission, seropositivity levels in metropolitan in Stockholm had reached approximately one in five persons, providing important baseline seroprevalence information prior to the start of vaccination.","Castro Dopico, X; Muschiol, S; Christian, M; Hanke, L; Sheward, D J; Grinberg, N F; Rorbach, J; Bogdanovic, G; Mcinerney, G M; Allander, T; Wallace, C; Murrell, B; Albert, J; Karlsson Hedestam, G B",,MEDLINE,,20210521.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joim.13304,covidwho-1234249,1365-2796,,J. intern. med,en,GB,2021.0,J Intern Med;2021 May 18. ,"Seropositivity in blood donors and pregnant women during the first year of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Stockholm, Sweden.",article,,,
"Introduction: No medication or therapies were found to be effective in controlling the covid-19 pandemic. The fast-track development of covid-19 vaccine brought some hope among health practitioners globally. The major challenge seems to be safety, efficacy, and acceptance of the vaccine. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among the community of the state of Odisha, India, to find out the concerns of safety and acceptance for the vaccine.Methods: A self-administered multiple-choice questionnaire containing 23 items with three sections was prepared in Google form and deployed following snow ball sampling method. The participants recruited were above 18?years of age residing in Odisha. The participation in the survey was completely voluntary. The survey was conducted during February 2021.Results and discussion: In total, 359 members participated in the survey. Majority of the respondent strongly agree/agree that covid-19 vaccine is safe for adults and children. Significant variation among all the groups was found regarding acquisition of higher immunity following infection rather by vaccination, effectiveness in infection prevention, safety in children, provision of mandatory vaccination by government, and public health protection following government guidelines.Conclusion: The major barrier to the covid-19 vaccination was found to be safety and awareness. But there is well acceptance to covid-19 vaccine among the community of Odisha, India, and further efforts to create awareness concerning safety and vaccination will be instrumental in the eradication of this infection.","Panda, Dibya Sundar; Giri, Ranjan Kumar; Nagarajappa, Anil Kumar; Basha, Sakeenabi",,MEDLINE,,20210521.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1924017,covidwho-1233822,2164-554X,,Hum Vaccin Immunother,en,US,2021.0,"Hum Vaccin Immunother;: 1-5, 2021 May 19.

"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is an important time for developing attitudes and beliefs about childhood vaccinations. Vaccinations are among the most effective way of preventing some infectious diseases. Discussions on vaccinations have increased due to the Covid-19 pandemic and there is an opportunity to give society correct information on vaccinations. AIM: The aim of the study was to determine the opinions of pregnant women on vaccinations in pregnancy and childhood and the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on these views. METHODS: The study was conducted as a cross-sectional study. The sample included 152 pregnant women. Data were collected through a 25-item online questionnaire created by the researchers. RESULTS: It was found in our study that 29.6% of pregnant women using forum websites exhibited hesitant attitudes towards vaccinations. The vaccine hesitancy rate was found to be high in pregnant women who said that their economic level was low and who worried about the risks of vaccination. The Covid-19 pandemic was reported to be the cause of a decrease in vaccine hesitancy in 28.9% of the participants. CONCLUSION: The events surrounding the pandemic provided an opportunity to explain how pregnant women feel about vaccinations.

"BACKGROUND: Although vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the most desired solution to end the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, there are growing concerns that vaccine hesitancy would undermine its potential. We examined the intention to receive vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and the associated factors in a representative sample of Chinese adults in Hong Kong. METHODS: We did a dual-frame (landline and mobile) cross-sectional survey of a random sample of 1501 Hong Kong residents aged 18?years or older (53.6% females) in April 2020. We collected data on the intention to receive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine when it becomes available (yes/ no/ undecided), knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19, smoking, alcohol drinking, and sociodemographic factors. Prevalence estimates were weighted by the sex, age, and education of the general population of Hong Kong. RESULTS: Overall, 45.3% (95% CI: 42.3-48.4%) of the participants had intentions to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2 when it becomes available, 29.2% (26.5-32.1%) were undecided, and 25.5% (22.9-28.2%) had no intention. The most common reason for vaccine hesitancy (undecided or no intention) was safety concerns (56.5%). Multivariable partial proportional odds model showed higher vaccine hesitancy in males, younger adults, those with no chronic disease, current smokers, and non-alcohol drinkers. After adjusting for sociodemographic and other factors, inadequate knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (adjusted ORs ranged from 1.27 to 2.63; P?&lt;?0.05) and lower perceived danger of COVID-19 (adjusted ORs ranged from 1.62 to 2.47; P?&lt;?0.001) were significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy. CONCLUSIONS: In a representative sample of Chinese adults in Hong Kong, only 45.3% of the participants intended to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2 when available. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with inadequate knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 transmission and lower perceived danger of COVID-19, which needed to be addressed to improve vaccination uptake.","Luk, Tzu Tsun; Zhao, Shengzhi; Wu, Yongda; Wong, Janet Yuen-Ha; Wang, Man Ping; Lam, Tai Hing",,MEDLINE,COVID-19; Vaccines; Adult; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hong Kong/epidemiology; Humans; Male; Prevalence; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination,20210521.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.05.036,covidwho-1233630,1873-2518,27,Vaccine,en,NL,2021.0,"Vaccine;39(27): 3602-3607, 2021 06 16.

"Vaccination is fast becoming a key intervention against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted cross-sectional online surveys to investigate COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across nine Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs;N = 10,183), assuming vaccine effectiveness at 90% and 95%. The prevalence of vaccine acceptance increased from 76.4% (90% effectiveness) to 88.8% (95% effectiveness). Considering a 90% effective vaccine, Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, and five African countries (Democratic Republic of Congo, Benin, Uganda, Malawi, and Mali) had lower acceptance odds compared to Brazil. Individuals who perceived taking the vaccine as important to protect themselves had the highest acceptance odds (aOR 2.49) at 95% effectiveness.Vaccine acceptance was also positively associated with COVID-19 knowledge, worry/fear regarding COVID-19, higher income, younger age, and testing negative for COVID-19. However, chronic disease and female gender reduced the odds for vaccine acceptance. The main reasons underpinning vaccine refusal were fear of side effects (41.2%) and lack of confidence in vaccine effectiveness (15.1%). Further research is needed to identify country-specific reasons for vaccine hesitancy in order to develop mitigation strategies that would ensure high and equitable vaccination coverage across LMICs.","Bono, Suzanna Awang, Faria de Moura Villela, Edlaine, Siau, Ching Sin, Chen, Won Sun, Pengpid, Supa, Hasan, M Tasdik, Sessou, Philippe, Ditekemena, John D.; Amodan, Bob Omoda, Hosseinipour, Mina C.; Dolo, Housseini, Siewe Fodjo, Joseph Nelson, Low, Wah Yun, Colebunders, Robert",,MDPI,,20210521.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9050515,covidwho-1234842,,5,Vaccines,en,,2021.0,"Vaccines; 9(5):515, 2021.",Factors Affecting COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance: An International Survey among Low- and Middle-Income Countries,article,,,9
"BACKGROUND: The 10-month timeline from conception to regulatory approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is unprecedented in modern medicine. However, the climate of the pandemic has also seen anti-vaccination sentiments flourish. AIMS: To determine the intent to accept COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare workers at a London Hospital Trust and examine variation in uptake between demographic groups. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey open to staff working at the trust. Staff rated on a five-point scale the likelihood of them accepting COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: We received 514 responses, representing 16% of the workforce. About 59% of staff intended to seek vaccination, 24% to reject and 17% were unsure. There was significantly reduced intended uptake in females, younger age groups, healthcare assistants, nurses, staff of black ethnic backgrounds and those who rejected influenza vaccination. Safety was the dominant concern. CONCLUSIONS: Our study finds COVID-19 vaccinate hesitancy is prevalent among healthcare workers at a London Hospital Trust. It is particularly concerning that hesitancy was highest amongst groups most exposed to COVID-19 and most at risk of severe disease.

"Because health care workers are a reliable source of health information, their acceptance or rejection of COVID-19 vaccines can influence the general population&#039;s uptake of COVID-19 vaccines. In this study, we sought to determine the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines among health care workers in Ghana. Using a cross-sectional design, we collected data from 234 health care workers through a self-administered online survey from 16 January to 15 February 2021. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed using STATA version 15. The findings revealed that 39.3% (n = 92) of health care workers intended to receive the COVID-19 vaccines. Factors such as sex (AOR = 0.451;CI 95% 0.240-0.845;p=0.013), category of health care workers (AOR = 2.851;95 CI%: 1.097-7.405;p=0.031), relative being diagnosed with COVID-19 (AOR = 0.369;CI 95% 0.145-0.941;p=0.037), and trust in the accuracy of the measures taken by the government in the fight against COVID-19 (AOR = 2.768;CI 95%: 1.365-5.616;p=0.005) proved to be significant predictors of the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine. Concerns about the safety of vaccines (n = 93, 65.5%) and the adverse side effects of the vaccines (n = 23, 14.8%) were identified as the main reasons why health care workers would decline uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in Ghana. The self-reported low intention of health care workers in Ghana to accept COVID-19 vaccines necessitates an urgent call from the Government of Ghana and other stakeholders to address health care workers&#039; concerns about the safety and adverse side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, as this would increase vaccine uptake. Interventions must also take into consideration sex and the category of health care workers to achieve the desired results. ? 2021 Martin Wiredu Agyekum et al.","Agyekum, M. W.; Afrifa-Anane, G.

"OBJECTIVES: A substantial proportion of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 do not experience noticeable symptoms typical of COVID-19. Our objectives were to evaluate the impact of the first wave of the pandemic in Qu¨¦bec by measuring SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence in a convenience sample of healthy blood donors and to study the association between seropositivity and the occurrence of COVID-19 symptoms. METHODS: The study design was a cross-sectional serological survey with a nested case-control study. Residual blood samples from donations collected between May 25 and July 9, 2020 (well before vaccination rollout) in the province of Qu¨¦bec were tested for anti-Spike RBD antibodies by ELISA. Seropositive donors and a control group of seronegative donors were questioned about prior COVID-19 symptoms. All qualified blood donors were eligible for participation. RESULTS: A total of 7691 blood donors were included in the study. After adjustments, the seroprevalence rate was 2.2% (95% CI 1.9-2.6). Seropositive donors reported one or more symptoms in a proportion of 52.2% (95% CI 44.2-60.1); this proportion was 19.1% (95% CI 13.4-26.1) among seronegative donors, suggesting that approximately 50-66% of all infections were asymptomatic. Univariate analysis of associations between symptoms and seropositivity revealed that except for rhinorrhea, all symptoms were significantly associated with seropositivity. CONCLUSION: Assuming that blood donors are fairly representative of the general adult population, this study shows that less than 3% of 18-69-year-olds have been infected during the first wave of the pandemic in the province of Qu¨¦bec. Our data also confirm that many infections escaped detection, including a substantial proportion that were asymptomatic.","Lewin, Antoine; Therrien, Roseline; De Serres, Gaston; Gr¨¦goire, Yves; Perreault, Jos¨¦e; Drouin, Mathieu; Fournier, Marie-Jos¨¦e; Tremblay, Tony; Beaudoin, Julie; Beaudoin-Bussi¨¨res, Guillaume; Pr¨¦vost, J¨¦r¨¦mie; Gendron-Lepage, Gabrielle; Finzi, Andr¨¦s; Bernier, France; Bazin, Ren¨¦e; Germain, Marc; Delage, Gilles",,MEDLINE,"Antibodies, Viral/blood; Blood Donors/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; COVID-19/epidemiology; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quebec/epidemiology; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Symptom Assessment; Young Adult",20210519.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.17269/s41997-021-00531-6,covidwho-1231627,1920-7476,4,Can J Public Health,en,CH,2021.0,"Can J Public Health;112(4): 576-586, 2021 08.

Focusing on the conditions in Bali, this study explored the level of compliance to public health measures targeted at COVID-19 and identified the determinants of compliance via the values, rules, and knowledge approach. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study conducted an online survey using the Google Form application from June 29 to July 5, 2020. The minimum required sample size was 664. Inclusion criteria were set as follows: 18 years of age or older and residing in Bali during the data collection period. Adherence was measured based on nine protocol indicators that were rated using a four-point Likert scale. A multiple linear regression analysis was then conducted to determine the associated factors of adherence to public health measures. Results: Of the 954 survey respondents, data from 743 were included for analysis. The average level of adherence to public health measures was 32.59 (range of 20-36). The linear regression analysis showed that perceived health benefits from public health measures, being female, and having COVID-19 test histories were significantly associated with adherence to public health measures. Conclusions: For public health measures targeted at COVID-19, adherence was strongly associated with perceived social norms, in which individuals played social community roles by adapting to standardized public health measures. It is thus imperative for governments to support and monitor public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Indrayathi, Putu Ayu; Januraga, Pande Putu; Pradnyani, Putu Erma; Gesesew, Hailay Abrha; Ward, Paul Russel",,MEDLINE,COVID-19; Pandemics; Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Indonesia; Public Health; SARS-CoV-2; Social Norms,20210519.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.646764,covidwho-1231424,2296-2565,,Front Public Health,en,CH,2021.0,"Front Public Health;9: 646764, 2021.

"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the parents&#039; willingness and attitudes concerning the COVID-19 vaccine. METHOD: This cross-sectional study was performed using a self-administered online survey, covering parents&#039; and their children&#039;s characteristics, parents&#039; willingness and attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 1035 parents participated. RESULTS: Analysis showed that 36.3% of parents were willing to have their children receive the COVID-19 vaccine and that 59.9% were willing to receive it themselves. In addition, 83.9% were willing to have their children vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine if the mortality rates associated with COVID-19 in children increased following a mutation. After adjusting for significant variables, willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (AOR?=?24.91; 95% CI?=?10.93-56.76), willingness for their children to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial (AOR?=?11a??.87; 95% CI?=?2.41-58.40] and advising others to receive the COVID-19 vaccine [AOR?=?7.82; 95% CI?=?2.50-24.49] were associated with greater parents&#039; willingness for their children to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Parents&#039; willingness for their children to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was low. The only characteristics of either parents or children found to affect the parents&#039; willingness for children to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was the parents being healthcare workers. Parents&#039; willingness and positive attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine are factors that increase acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine for their children.","Yilmaz, Meltem; Sahin, Mustafa Kursat",,MEDLINE,,20210519.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14364,covidwho-1231124,1742-1241,,Int J Clin Pract,en,GB,2021.0,"Int J Clin Pract;: e14364, 2021 May 16.

"INTRODUCTION: The new coronavirus pandemic has appreciably impacted morbidity and mortality, as well as having an economic impact worldwide. New vaccines are a potential way forward to reduce transmission rates and subsequent infection. In Brazil, vaccines are being distributed via the public sector; however, in the future, they will be available in the private market. Information about consumers&#039; willingness to pay (WTP) for a hypothetical vaccine against SARS CoV-2 can help future price setting discussions. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with consumers in the five regions of Brazil regarding the WTP for a hypothetical vaccine against SARS CoV-2 with a 50% efficacy. RESULTS: A total of 1402 individuals over 18?years of age who declared not having COVID-19 at the time of the survey were interviewed. The acceptability for this hypothetical vaccine was 80.7%. In addition, the amount of WTP by Brazilian consumers for a hypothetical SARS CoV-2 vaccine was estimated at US$ 22.18(120.00 BRL). CONCLUSION: This study can contribute to decision-making to inform potential pricing for a hypothetical SARS CoV-2 vaccine.","Dias-God¨®i, Isabella Piassi; Tadeu Rocha Sarmento, T¨²lio; Afonso Reis, Edna; Peres Gargano, Ludmila; Godman, Brian; de Assis Acurcio, Francisco; Alvares-Teodoro, Juliana; Guerra J¨²nior, Augusto Afonso; Mariano Ruas, Cristina",,MEDLINE,,20210519.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14737167.2021.1931128,covidwho-1230997,1744-8379,,Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res,en,GB,2021.0,"Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res;: 1-11, 2021 Jun 14.

"Objective: This study aimed to investigate association between conspiracy beliefs, trusts in media and authoritative information sources, with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Methods: We conducted online survey on adult resident of Bali Province, Indonesia in September 14th to October 31st 2020 collecting data on demographics, impacts of the pandemic, conspiracy beliefs, trusts in conventional media and authoritative sources, as well as vaccine acceptance. We conducted bivariate and multivariate analysis for determinants of vaccine acceptance with SPSS 23.0. Results: We recruited 779 respondents with 38.9% male and median age of 24 years old (IQR 20 - 26). The result showed vaccine acceptance of 60.8%. Vaccine acceptance was correlated with conspiracy beliefs, trusts in conventional media and authoritative sources with Spearman&#039;s rho of -0.350, 0.269, and 0.287 respectively. Controlling for demographics and impacts of pandemic, showed strong conspiracy beliefs and trust in conventional media as the only independent determinants with OR of 0.33 (CI95% 0.20 - 0.54) and 1.91 (CI95% 1.37 - 2.65) respectively. Conclusion: The results indicated considerable impacts of infodemic, represented by conspiracy beliefs, trust in media, and in authoritative sources, toward COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.

"The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the difficulty of the US public health system to respond effectively to vulnerable subpopulations, causing disproportionate rates of morbidity and mortality. New York Haredi-Orthodox Jewish communities represent a group that have been heavily impacted by Covid-19. Little research has examined their experience or perceptions toward Covid-19 and vaccines. We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study to explore the experience of Covid-19 among Haredim. Paper surveys were self-administered between December 2020 and January 2021 in Haredi neighborhood pediatricians&#039; offices in Brooklyn, New York. Of 102 respondents, 43% reported either a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral or antibody test. Participants trusted their physicians, Orthodox medical organizations, and rabbinic leaders for medical information. Knowledge of Covid-19 transmission and risk was good (69% answered &amp;#8805; 4/6 questions correctly). Only 12% of respondents would accept a Covid-19 vaccine, 41% were undecided and 47% were strongly hesitant. Independent predictors of strong vaccine hesitancy included believing natural infection to be better than vaccination for developing immunity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-14.86), agreement that prior infection provides a path toward resuming communal life (aOR 4.10; 95% CI 1.22-13.77), and pandemic-related loss of trust in physicians (aOR 5.01; 95% CI 1.05-23.96). The primary disseminators of health information for self-protective religious communities should be stakeholders who understand these groups&#039; unique health needs. In communities with significant Covid-19 experience, vaccination messaging may need to be tailored toward protecting infection-na?ve individuals and boosting natural immunity against emerging variants.","Carmody, Ellie R; Zander, Devon; Klein, Elizabeth J; Mulligan, Mark J; Caplan, Arthur L",,MEDLINE,,20210519.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10900-021-00995-0,covidwho-1230268,1573-3610,,J. community health,en,NL,2021.0,J Community Health;2021 May 17. ,Knowledge and Attitudes Toward Covid-19 and Vaccines Among a New York Haredi-Orthodox Jewish Community.,article,,,
"A COVID-19 vaccine can be an important key for mitigating the spread of the pandemic, provided that it is accepted by a sufficient proportion of the population. This study investigated parents&#039; intention to get vaccinated and to have one&#039;s child vaccinated against COVID-19. In May 2020, 612 parents participating with their child in the KUNO-Kids health study completed an online survey. Multivariable logistic regression models were calculated to analyze predictors of intention to vaccinate. Fifty-eight percent of parents intended to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and 51% intended to have their child vaccinated. Significant predictors for the intention to get vaccinated and for having the child vaccinated included stronger parental confidence in one&#039;s knowledge about prevention measures and lower beliefs that policy measures were exaggerated.Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy was considerable in our sample of parents in Germany. However, our study revealed some potentially modifiable factors which should be addressed by a comprehensive and tailored communication and education strategy. What is Known? a?¡é A COVID-19 vaccine can mitigate the spread of the pandemic. a?¡é Many parents are skeptical about vaccinations in general. What is New? a?¡é COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy was considerable in our sample of parents from Germany, not only for getting vaccinated but also for having the child vaccinated. a?¡é Negative parental attitudes regarding policy measures to contain the pandemic were associated with a lower intention to vaccinate.","Brandstetter, Susanne; B?hmer, Merle M; Pawellek, Maja; Seelbach-G?bel, Birgit; Melter, Michael; Kabesch, Michael; Apfelbacher, Christian",,MEDLINE,,20210519.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00431-021-04094-z,covidwho-1230237,1432-1076,,Eur. j. pediatr,en,DE,2021.0,Eur J Pediatr;2021 May 17. ,Parents&#039; intention to get vaccinated and to have their child vaccinated against COVID-19: cross-sectional analyses using data from the KUNO-Kids health study.,article,,,
"Background: In the absence of a vaccine, governments have focused on social distancing, self-isolation, and increased hygiene procedures to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Compliance with these measures requires voluntary cooperation from citizens. Yet, compliance is not complete. Existing research on the predictors of compliance is almost exclusively based on cross-sectional data, raising the possibility of reverse causality and confounding. Methods: Using data from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study, a large weekly online panel of UK adults from first three months of lockdown in the UK (n = 51,600), we tested whether within-person changes in confidence in government, mental wellbeing, social experiences and awareness of COVID-19 were longitudinally related to self-reported compliance levels with guidelines from authorities using random intercept cross-lagged panel models. Findings: We found evidence of a small longitudinal association between increased confidence in government to tackle the pandemic and higher self-reported compliance, but little evidence that factors such as mental health and wellbeing, worries about future adversities, and social isolation and loneliness were related to later compliance. We found higher self-reported compliance was longitudinally related to higher depressive symptoms. We found that low compliance was related to lower leisure engagement, providing care, and working outside the home. Interpretation: Our results suggest that to effectively manage the pandemic, governments should ensure that confidence is maintained.

"INTRODUCTION: The outbreak of novel COVID-19 caught the world off guard in the first quarter of 2020. To stem the tide of this pandemic, there was acceleration of the development, testing and prelicensure approval for emergency use of some COVID-19 vaccine candidates. This led to raised public concern about their safety and efficacy, compounding the challenges of vaccine hesitancy. The onus of managing and administering these vaccines to a sceptical populace when they do become available rests mostly on the shoulders of healthcare workers (HCWs). Therefore, the vaccine confidence levels of HCWs become critical to the success of vaccination endeavours. This proposed study aims to estimate the level of vaccine confidence and the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine among future HCWs and their trainers at a specific university in Cape Town, South Africa, and to identify any vaccination concerns early for targeted intervention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This proposed study is a cross-sectional survey study. An online questionnaire will be distributed to all current staff and students of the Faculty of Medicine Health Sciences of Stellenbosch University in Cape Town, South Africa. No sampling strategy will be employed. The survey questionnaire will consist of demographic questions (consisting of six items) and vaccine confidence questions (comprising six items in Likert scale format). Log binomial models will be employed to identify factors associated with vaccine confidence and intention. The strength of association will be assessed using the OR and its 95% CI. Statistical significance will be defined at a p value &lt;0.05. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been obtained for the study from Stellenbosch University (Human Research Ethics Committee reference number S19/01/014 (PhD)). The results will be shared with relevant health authorities, presented at conferences and published in a peer-reviewed journal.","Oduwole, Elizabeth O; Mahomed, Hassan; Ayele, Birhanu T; Wiysonge, Charles Shey",,MEDLINE,COVID-19; Vaccines; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; South Africa; Students; Vaccination,20210518.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049877,covidwho-1228888,2044-6055,5,BMJ Open,en,GB,2021.0,"BMJ Open;11(5): e049877, 2021 05 13.

"Background: Vaccine hesitancy has been recognized as an urgent public health issue. We aimed to explore the acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine and related factors among pregnant women, a vulnerable population for vaccine-preventable diseases.Methods: A multi-center cross-sectional study among pregnant women was conducted in five provinces of mainland China from November 13 to 27, 2020. We collected sociodemographic characteristics, attitude, knowledge, and health beliefs on COVID-19 vaccination. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing regression analysis was used to assess the trends of vaccination acceptance. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors related to vaccination acceptance.Results: Among the 1392 pregnant women, the acceptance rate of a COVID-19 vaccine were 77.4% (95%CI 75.1-79.5%). In the multivariable regression model, the acceptance rate was associated with young age (aOR?=?1.87, 95% CI: 1.20-2.93), western region (aOR?=?2.73, 95% CI: 1.72-4.32), low level of education (aOR?=?2.49, 95% CI: 1.13-5.51), late pregnancy (aOR?=?1.49, 95% CI: 1.03-2.16), high knowledge score on COVID-19 (aOR?=?1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.10), high level of perceived susceptibility (aOR?=?2.18, 95% CI: 1.36-3.49), low level of perceived barriers (aOR?=?4.76, 95% CI: 2.23-10.18), high level of perceived benefit (aOR?=?2.18, 95% CI: 1.36-3.49), and high level of perceived cues to action (aOR?=?15.70, 95% CI: 8.28-29.80).Conclusions: About one quarters of pregnant women have vaccine hesitancy. Our findings highlight that targeted and multipronged efforts are needed to build vaccine literacy and confidence to increase the acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for vulnerable populations.","Tao, Liyuan; Wang, Ruitong; Han, Na; Liu, Jihong; Yuan, Chuanxiang; Deng, Lixia; Han, Chunhua; Sun, Fenglan; Liu, Min; Liu, Jue",,MEDLINE,,20210518.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1892432,covidwho-1228401,2164-554X,,Hum Vaccin Immunother,en,US,2021.0,"Hum Vaccin Immunother;: 1-10, 2021 May 14.

"With the planned COVID-19 vaccine, vaccine hesitation is a great challenge, particularly for healthcare professionals. In this study, we examined the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine by health care workers, their concerns about it, and the reasons that might prevent them from getting vaccinated. We conducted a cross-sectional study using an anonymous online survey from December 25, 2020, to January 6, 2021. The questionnaire consisted of demographic characteristics (age, gender, profession, sector, medical history, and general health), COVID-19 related knowledge, and personal history of influenza vaccination. The intention to get the vaccine once it is available was directly asked, and attitudes towards the diseases and the vaccine were studied using a four-point Likert scale statement based on the health belief model&#039;s constructs. The study included 1159 HCWs; 62.9% were females, and 52.5% were between the ages of 30-49?years. The intention to get vaccinated was only 37.8% [95%CI: 35.0%-40.6%], while 31.5% were undecided, and 30.7% planned to refuse it. Higher levels of intention were reported among males (OR; 2.7, 95%CI: 2.0-3.7), younger ages (OR 1.7, 95%CI: 1.1-2.8), physicians (OR; 2.9, 95%CI: 2.0-4.0), HCWs at non-governmental settings (OR; 1.4, 95%CI: 1.1-1.9), those who previously received the influenza vaccine (OR 4.0, 95%CI: 2.3-7.1), and those who had higher COVID-19 related knowledge (OR; 1.7, 95%CI: 2.3-7.1). In conclusion, vaccine acceptance among HCWs was much lower than expected, which would greatly diminish the role of vaccination in reducing the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the community.","Maraqa, Beesan; Nazzal, Zaher; Rabi, Razan; Sarhan, Nafez; Al-Shakhra, Kamal; Al-Kaila, Mai",,MEDLINE,COVID-19 Vaccines; COVID-19; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; SARS-CoV-2,20210518.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106618,covidwho-1228175,1096-0260,,Prev Med,en,US,2021.0,"Prev Med;149: 106618, 2021 08.

"BACKGROUND: Vaccine hesitancy is an important public health problem. AIMS: Identifying and understanding COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy may aid future public health messaging. This study, in which we planned to study the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, aims to reveal the relationship between &quot;intolerance of uncertainty,&quot; &quot;belief in conspiracy theories,&quot; and &quot;COVID-19 phobia&quot; with vaccine hesitancy. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted during a COVID-19 outbreak. Participants were reached via various social media platforms and e-mailing lists for convenience. Data were collected with an online survey using SurveyMonkey application. &quot;Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12),&quot; &quot;Conspiracy Mentality Scale (CMS),&quot; and &quot;COVID-19 Phobia Scale&quot; were applied to 488 participants. Statistical significance level was considered p &lt; 0.05. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-eight people between the ages of 18 and 65 participated. Twenty-one participants were excluded from the analysis due to random marking and unreasonable filling times (&lt; 10?min). In this way, analyzes were made with 467 people. We found a positive correlation between the belief in conspiracy theories and vaccine hesitancy (p &lt; 0.05). And also found that individuals with low fear of COVID-19 would hesitate about vaccination (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine hesitancy is an important public health problem, and it puts public health at risk, especially during the epidemic period we live in. Therefore, it is important to understand the psychological factors involved in vaccine hesitancy.

"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers are encouraged annually to get vaccinated against influenza. This year in view of COVID-19 pandemic, attitudes of HCWs towards vaccination are particularly important. A cross-sectional study was completed to understand how to best encourage and facilitate the vaccination of HCWs based on the previous years&#039; findings. METHODS: An online survey was disseminated to all hospital staff via electronic channels. The clinical audit sphinx software was used for data collection and analysis. RESULTS: The total number of responses was n = 728, almost double the rate from 2018 (N = 393). A total of 78% (N = 551) of participants were vaccinated last year. A total of 94% (N = 677) of participants reported their intention to be vaccinated this year. The main barriers listed were being unable to find time (32%, N = 36), side effects (30%, N = 33) and thinking that it does not work (21%, N = 23). The most popular suggestions for how to increase uptake were more mobile immunisation clinics (72%, N = 517) and more information on the vaccine (50%, N = 360). A total of 82% of participants (N = 590) agreed that healthcare workers should be vaccinated, with 56% (N = 405) agreeing that it should be mandatory. Of the participants who were not vaccinated last year (N = 159), 40% (N = 63) agreed that COVID-19 had changed their opinion on influenza immunisation with a further 11% (N = 18) strongly agreeing. DISCUSSION: In light of the increasing number of survey participants, more staff were interested in flu vaccination this year than ever before. The COVID-19 pandemic has had some influence on staff&#039;s likelihood to be vaccinated. Feasibility of immunisation and education posed the largest barriers to HCW vaccination.","Kearns, Emma C; Callanan, Ian; O&#039;Reilly, Ann; Purcell, Aisling; Tuohy, Niamh; Bulfin, Siobhan; Smyth, Angela; Bairead, Emer; Fitzgerald, Susan; Feeney, Eoin; Waqas, Sarmad",,MEDLINE,,20210518.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11845-021-02636-w,covidwho-1227915,1863-4362,,Ir. j. med. sci,en,IE,2021.0,Ir J Med Sci;2021 May 13. ,Changing attitudes towards annual influenza vaccination amongst staff in a Tertiary Care Irish University Hospital.,article,,,
"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is still a major global threat for which vaccination remains the ultimate solution. Uganda reported 40,751 cases and 335 deaths as of 9 April 2021 and started its vaccination program among priority groups like health workers, teachers, those with chronic diseases among others in early March 2021. Unanimous uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine is required to subsequently avert its spread;therefore, we assessed COVID-19 vaccine acceptability, hesitancy, and associated factors among medical students in Uganda. METHODS: This study employed an online descriptive cross-sectional survey among medical students across 10 medical schools in Uganda. A structured questionnaire via Google Form was conveniently sent to eligible participants via WhatsApp. Each medical school had a coordinator who consistently shared the data tool in the WhatsApp groups. Chi-square or Fisher&#039;s exact test, and logistic regression were used to assess the association between vaccine acceptability with demographics, COVID-19 risk perception, and vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: We surveyed 600 medical students, 377 (62.8%) were male. COVID-19 vaccine acceptability was 37.3% and vaccine hesitancy 30.7%. Factors associated with vaccine acceptability were being male (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.9, p=0.001) and being single (aOR= 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-3.9, p=0.022). Very high (aOR= 3.5, 95% CI 1.7-6.9, p&amp;lt;0.001) or moderate (aOR =2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.1, p=0.008) perceived risk of getting COVID-19 in the future, receiving any vaccine in the past 5 years (aOR= 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.5, p=0.017), and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (aOR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9, p=0.036). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed low levels of acceptance towards the COVID-19 vaccine among medical students, low self-perceived risks of COVID-19, and many had relied on social media that provided them with negative information. This poses an evident risk on the battle towards COVID-19 in the future especially when these future health professions are expected to be influencing decisions of the general public towards the same.","Kanyike, A.

"Vaccination is the most promising strategy to counter the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Vaccine hesitancy is a serious global phenomenon, and therefore the aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore the effect of educational background, work field, and social media on attitudes towards vaccination in Jordan. We compared between medical personnel who were in direct contact with patients and non-medical individuals at Jordan University Hospital in terms of demographics, knowledge about COVID-19 vaccines, rumors received via social media, their trust in these vaccines, and the encouraging factors for vaccination. 646 individuals were enrolled in this study, of which 287 (44.4%) were from medical field, and 359 (55.6%) from non-medical field. 226 (35%) were planning to take the vaccine once available, with a positive response from 131 (45.6%) medical field workers, compared to 94 (26.2%) non-medical individuals (p &lt; 0.001). The social media rumor that was believed the most was the unsafety of these vaccines (n = 283; 43.8%). Only 163 (56.8%) of medical persons did not believe any of the circulated rumors, compared to 126 (35.1%) of non-medical persons (p &lt; 0.001). The effect of medical personnel advice (OR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.70 to 0.98; p = 0.026) and social media (OR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.41; p = 0.012) were significantly associated with the willingness to take COVID-19 vaccine once available. In conclusion, medical personnel and social media play a crucial role in increasing the society&#039;s inclination towards vaccination by providing the community with updated evidence-based information about COVID-19 vaccines as an efficient medical countermeasure and by correcting the previously spread misinformation.","Aloweidi, Abdelkarim; Bsisu, Isam; Suleiman, Aiman; Abu-Halaweh, Sami; Almustafa, Mahmoud; Aqel, Mohammad; Amro, Aous; Radwan, Neveen; Assaf, Dima; Abdullah, Malak Ziyad; Albataineh, Malak; Mahasneh, Aya; Badaineh, Ala&#039;a; Obeidat, Hala",,MEDLINE,COVID-19; Vaccines; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Jordan; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination,20210517.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18105111,covidwho-1227022,1660-4601,10,Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),en,CH,2021.0,Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(10)2021 May 12. ,Hesitancy towards COVID-19 Vaccines: An Analytical Cross-Sectional Study.,article,,,18
"Introduction: Although acute transverse myelitis (ATM) is a rare neurological condition (1.34-4.6 cases per million/year) COVID-19-associated ATM cases have occurred during the pandemic. Case-finding methods: We report a patient from Panama with SARS-CoV-2 infection complicated by ATM and present a comprehensive clinical review of 43 patients with COVID-19-associated ATM from 21 countries published from March 2020 to January 2021. In addition, 3 cases of ATM were reported as serious adverse events during the clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222). Results: All patients had typical features of ATM with acute onset of paralysis, sensory level and sphincter deficits due to spinal cord lesions demonstrated by imaging. There were 23 males (53%) and 20 females (47%) ranging from ages 21- to 73- years-old (mean age, 49 years), with two peaks at 29 and 58 years, excluding 3 pediatric cases. The main clinical manifestations were quadriplegia (58%) and paraplegia (42%). MRI reports were available in 40 patients; localized ATM lesions affected &amp;#8804;3 cord segments (12 cases, 30%) at cervical (5 cases) and thoracic cord levels (7 cases); 28 cases (70%) had longitudinally-extensive ATM (LEATM) involving &amp;#8805;4 spinal cord segments (cervicothoracic in 18 cases and thoracolumbar-sacral in 10 patients). Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) occurred in 8 patients, mainly women (67%) ranging from 27- to 64-years-old. Three ATM patients also had blindness from myeloneuritis optica (MNO) and two more also had acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN). Conclusions: We found ATM to be an unexpectedly frequent neurological complication of COVID-19. Most cases (68%) had a latency of 10 days to 6 weeks that may indicate post-infectious neurological complications mediated by the host&#039;s response to the virus. In 32% a brief latency (15 hours to 5 days) suggested a direct neurotropic effect of SARS-CoV-2. The occurrence of 3 reported ATM adverse effects among 11,636 participants in the AZD1222 vaccine trials is extremely high considering a worldwide incidence of 0.5/million COVID-19-associated ATM cases found in this report. The pathogenesis of ATM remains unknown, but it is conceivable that SARS-CoV-2 antigens -perhaps also present in the AZD1222 COVID-19 vaccine or its chimpanzee adenovirus adjuvant- may induce immune mechanisms leading to the myelitis.","Rom¨¢n, Gustavo C; Gracia, Fernando; Torres, Antonio; Palacios, Alexis; Gracia, Karla; Harris, Di¨®genes",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19 Vaccines/adverse effects; COVID-19/complications; Myelitis, Transverse/complications; SARS-CoV-2/pathogenicity; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myelitis, Transverse/diagnosis; Myelitis, Transverse/pathology; Myelitis, Transverse/physiopathology; Nervous System Diseases/complications; Nervous System Diseases/diagnosis; Nervous System Diseases/pathology; Nervous System Diseases/physiopathology; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; SARS-CoV-2/physiology; Spinal Cord/diagnostic imaging; Spinal Cord/pathology; Spinal Cord/physiopathology; Viral Tropism; Young Adult",20210517.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.653786,covidwho-1226977,1664-3224,,Front Immunol,en,CH,2021.0,"Front Immunol;12: 653786, 2021.

"Despite the fact that more than a year has passed since the WHO declared the pandemic, there is still no effectivetreatment of COVID-19. According to current knowledge, the only method to stop the virus from spreading is prophylactic vaccination of the population. However, to achieve herd immunity, 60¨C72% of the population needs to be vaccinated, which is a significant challenge for current healthcare systems. As it has already been proven, having an effective vaccine is not the same as using it. Public acceptance is essential here. The study aimed to assess the changes in the attitudes of online respondents toward vaccination against COVID-19 over time. In the research, a questionnaire designed by the author of the study was used and it was distributed via the Internet in two stages. The questionnaire included a section assessing a sociodemographic status as well as the questions, designed by the author, evaluating the willingness of the respondents to get vaccinated and their main concerns associated with it. The first stage covered the period before the commencement of the population vaccination programme in Poland, i.e., 14¨C27 December 2020. Then, the survey was redistributed 2 months after the vaccination programme was started, i.e., 1¨C19 March 2021. Participation in the study was fully anonymous, voluntary and there was a possibility to opt out at any stage of the research. A total of 2048 respondents were surveyed and 26 persons refused to be involved in the research. A total number of 2022 responses were analysed. Stage I of the research involved 22.9% of the respondents (463 persons). The questions were answered by 1559 persons (72.9%) after the survey was redistributed. Among the participants of stage II of the study, 422 (27.1%) persons have already been vaccinated against COVID-19. A comparison of the responses that were collected from both stages of the study showed a slight increase in the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 over time. It turned out that women, residents of large cities, people with a higher level of education and healthcare workers showed a more favourable attitude toward vaccination. According to the results of the survey, chronic diseases do not have a significant impact on the attitude toward vaccinations (p = 0.155). As the social vaccination promotion campaign continued, a slight increase in the willingness to get vaccinated was observed. According to the survey, women, residents of large cities and those with higher education demonstrated more favourable attitudes toward getting vaccinated against COVID-19. It should be stressed that despite the passage of time and the increasing experience with the new types of vaccines against COVID-19, the percentage of people who are afraid of the complications after the vaccination has not decreased significantly and the concern related to the ineffectiveness of vaccination has dramatically increased. This demonstrates the limited effectiveness of the current information system regarding passing the knowledge on of the safety and efficiency of vaccination and it indicates a necessity to modernise it as soon as possible.","Babicki, Mateusz, Mastalerz-Migas, Agnieszka",,MDPI,,20210517.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9050503,covidwho-1227078,,5,Vaccines,en,,2021.0,"Vaccines; 9(5):503, 2021.",Attitudes toward Vaccination against COVID-19 in Poland.

"Background: While the COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally, health systems are overwhelmed by both direct and indirect mortality from other treatable conditions. COVID-19 vaccination was crucial to preventing and eliminating the disease, so vaccine development for COVID-19 was fast-tracked worldwide. Despite the fact that vaccination is commonly recognized as the most effective approach, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), vaccine hesitancy is a global health issue. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of nurses in four different regions in Italy between 20 and 28 December 2020 to obtain data on the acceptance of the upcoming COVID-19 vaccination in order to plan specific interventions to increase the rate of vaccine coverage. Results: A total of 531 out of the 5000 nurses invited completed the online questionnaire. Most of the nurses enrolled in the study (73.4%) were female. Among the nurses, 91.5% intended to accept vaccination, whereas 2.3% were opposed and 6.2% were undecided. Female sex and confidence in vaccine efficacy represent the main predictors of vaccine intention among the study population using a logistic regression model, while other factors including vaccine safety concerns (side effects) were non-significant. Conclusions: Despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine, intention to be vaccinated was suboptimal among nurses in our sample. We also found a significant number of people undecided as to whether to accept the vaccine. Contrary to expectations, concerns about the safety of the vaccine were not found to affect the acceptance rate;nurses¡¯ perception of vaccine efficacy and female sex were the main influencing factors on attitudes toward vaccination in our sample. Since the success of the COVID-19 immunization plan depends on the uptake rate, these findings are of great interest for public health policies. Interventions aimed at increasing employee awareness of vaccination efficacy should be promoted among nurses in order to increase the number of vaccinated people.","Trabucco Aurilio, Marco, Mennini, Francesco Saverio, Gazzillo, Simone, Massini, Laura, Bolcato, Matteo, Feola, Alessandro, Ferrari, Cristiana, Coppeta, Luca",,MDPI,,20210517.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9050500,covidwho-1227076,,5,Vaccines,en,,2021.0,"Vaccines; 9(5):500, 2021.",Intention to Be Vaccinated for COVID-19 among Italian Nurses during the Pandemic,article,,,9
"Background: In order to achieve long-term optimum public health response, herd immunity is required, and this may happen if general populations willingly offered the COVID- 19 vaccine. The current study aimed to explore the attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccine, and to outline the common barriers interfering with vaccination among Egyptian population. A cross-sectional study has been carried out among 1282 participants utilizing a self-administered questionnaire. Results: Negative attitude was associated with low trust in the capability of the country instructions to combat COVID-19 (OR=5.97, CI95%: 3.37-10.57), unsatisfactory knowledge (OR=15.73 CI95%: 9.54-25.92), being worried about adverse effects (OR=2.97, CI95%: 1.96-4.52), being not committed to protection measures like PPE, HH and social isolation (OR=2.16, CI95%: 1.42-3.25), not working (OR=3.04, CI95%: 2.11-4.36), low education (OR=10.12, CI95%: 7.11-14.40), don&#039;t know deep experienced trials of vaccines (OR=1.76, CI95%: 1.45-2.13), being female (OR=3.09, CI95%: 2.17-4.39), increase age (OR=1.03, CI95%: 1.01-1.06) and depression symptoms (OR=1.64, CI95%: 1.12-2.41).

"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 has caused significant morbidity and mortality in nursing homes. Vaccination against SARS-COV-2 holds promise for reduction in COVID-19. This operational analysis describes the proportion of SARS-COV-2 positive tests before, during, and after vaccination. DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal cohort analysis from October 1, 2020 until February 14, 2021. SETTING: A total of 130 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Community Living Centers (CLC), analogous to nursing homes. INTERVENTION: Vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. MEASUREMENTS: The primary measure is the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests among CLC residents. In a pooled analysis of weekly testing and vaccine data, the proportion of positive tests was compared for the unvaccinated, first dose, and second dose. For each CLC, we identified the week in which 50% of CLC residents were vaccinated (index week). The analysis aligned the index week for CLCs and examined the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests at the CLC level before and after. As a reference, we plotted the proportion of positive tests in nursing homes in the same county as the CLC using publicly reported data. RESULTS: Within the pooled VA CLCs, the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose was delivered to 50% of CLC residents within 1?week of availability and second dose within 5 weeks. Relative to the index week, the risk ratio of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests in the vaccinated relative to unvaccinated was significantly lower in Week 4 (relative risk 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.68). Throughout the study period, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests in community nursing homes was higher compared to VA CLC and also declined after vaccine availability. CONCLUSION: The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests significantly declined in VA CLCs 4 weeks after vaccine delivery and continued to decline in vaccinated and unvaccinated residents. The results describe the importance of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and vaccination in VA nursing home residents.","Rudolph, James L; Hartronft, Scotte; McConeghy, Kevin; Kennedy, Michael; Intrator, Orna; Minor, Lisa; Hubert, Terrence L; Goldstein, Mary K",,MEDLINE,,20210514.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17180,covidwho-1225672,1532-5415,,J. am. geriatr. soc,en,US,2021.0,J Am Geriatr Soc;2021 Apr 16. ,Proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests and vaccination in Veterans Affairs Community Living Centers.,article,,,
"BACKGROUND: The duration of humoral and T and cell response after the infection of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study to assess the virus-specific antibody and memory T and B cell responses in COVID-19 patients up to 343 days after infection. Neutralizing antibodies and antibodies against the receptor-binding domain, spike, and nucleoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 were measured. Virus-specific memory T and B cell responses were analyzed. RESULTS: We enrolled 59 COVID-19 patients, including 38 moderate, 16 mild, and five asymptomatic patients; 31 (52.5%) were men, and 28 (47.5%) were women. The median age was 41 (interquartile range [IQR]: 30-55). The median day from symptom onset to enrollment was 317 days (range 257 to 343 days). We found that approximately 90% of patients still have detectable IgG antibodies against spike and nucleocapsid proteins and neutralizing antibodies against pseudovirus, whereas ~60% of patients had detectable IgG antibodies against receptor binding domain and surrogate virus-neutralizing antibodies. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG + memory B cell and IFN-?3 secreting T cell responses were detectable in over 70% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2-specific immune memory response persists in most patients nearly one year after infection, which provides a promising sign for prevention from reinfection and vaccination strategy.","Yao, Lin; Wang, Guo-Lin; Shen, Yuan; Wang, Zhuang-Ye; Zhan, Bing-Dong; Duan, Li-Jun; Lu, Bing; Shi, Chao; Gao, Yu-Meng; Peng, Hong-Hong; Wang, Guo-Qiang; Wang, Dong-Mei; Jiang, Ming-Dong; Cao, Guo-Ping; Ma, Mai-Juan",,MEDLINE,,20210514.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab255,covidwho-1225628,1537-6613,,J. infect. dis,en,US,2021.0,J Infect Dis;2021 May 12. ,Persistence of Antibody and Cellular Immune Responses in COVID-19 patients over Nine Months after Infection.,article,,,
"BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza and influenza-associated complications including those leading to hospitalization. Resources otherwise used for influenza could support caring for patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Health Center Program serves 30 million people annually by providing comprehensive primary health care, including influenza vaccination, to demographically diverse and historically underserved communities. As racial and ethnic minority groups have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, the objective of this analysis was to assess disparities in influenza vaccination at HRSA-funded health centers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and HRSA analyzed cross-sectional data on influenza vaccinations from a weekly, voluntary Health Center COVID-19 survey after addition of an influenza-related question covering November 7-27, 2020. RESULTS: During the three-week period, 1,126 (81%) of 1385 health centers responded to the survey. Most of the 811,738 influenza vaccinations took place in urban areas and in the Western US Region. There were disproportionately more health center influenza vaccinations among racial and ethnic minorities in comparison with county demographics, except among Non-Hispanic Blacks and American Indian/Alaska Natives. CONCLUSIONS: HRSA-funded health centers were able to quickly vaccinate large numbers of mostly racial or ethnic minority populations, disproportionately more than county demographics. However, additional efforts might be needed to reach specific racial populations and persons in rural areas. Success in influenza vaccination efforts can support success in SARS-CoV-2 vaccination efforts.","Marks, Suzanne M; Clara, Alexey; Fiebelkorn, Amy Parker; Le, Xuan; Armstrong, Paige A; Campbell, Stephanie; Van Alstyne, Judith Mendel; Price, Sarah; Bolton, Joshua; Sandhu, Paramjit K; Bombard, Jennifer M; Strona, F V",,MEDLINE,,20210514.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab318,covidwho-1225620,1537-6591,,Clin. infect. dis,en,US,2021.0,Clin Infect Dis;2021 May 12. ,"Influenza Vaccination in Health Centers during the COVID-19 Pandemic-United States, November 7-27, 2020.",article,,,
"Understanding how antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 evolve during infection may provide important insight into therapeutic approaches and vaccination for COVID-19. Here we profile the antibody responses of 162 COVID-19 symptomatic patients in the COVID-BioB cohort followed longitudinally for up to eight months from symptom onset to find SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, as well as antibodies either recognizing SARS-CoV-2 spike antigens and nucleoprotein, or specific for S2 antigen of seasonal beta-coronaviruses and hemagglutinin of the H1N1 flu virus. The presence of neutralizing antibodies within the first weeks from symptoms onset correlates with time to a negative swab result (p = 0.002), while the lack of neutralizing capacity correlates with an increased risk of a fatal outcome (p = 0.008). Neutralizing antibody titers progressively drop after 5-8 weeks but are still detectable up to 8 months in the majority of recovered patients regardless of age or co-morbidities, with IgG to spike antigens providing the best correlate of neutralization. Antibody responses to seasonal coronaviruses are temporarily boosted, and parallel those to SARS-CoV-2 without dampening the specific response or worsening disease progression. Our results thus suggest compromised immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike to be a major trait of COVID-19 patients with critical conditions, and thereby inform on the planning of COVID-19 patient care and therapy prioritization.","Dispinseri, Stefania; Secchi, Massimiliano; Pirillo, Maria Franca; Tolazzi, Monica; Borghi, Martina; Brigatti, Cristina; De Angelis, Maria Laura; Baratella, Marco; Bazzigaluppi, Elena; Venturi, Giulietta; Sironi, Francesca; Canitano, Andrea; Marzinotto, Ilaria; Tresoldi, Cristina; Ciceri, Fabio; Piemonti, Lorenzo; Negri, Donatella; Cara, Andrea; Lampasona, Vito; Scarlatti, Gabriella",,MEDLINE,"Antibodies, Neutralizing/immunology; COVID-19/immunology; COVID-19/mortality; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; Aged; Antibodies, Viral/immunology; Antibody Formation; Betacoronavirus/immunology; COVID-19/virology; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin G/immunology; Kinetics; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Neutralization Tests; SARS-CoV-2/isolation &amp;amp; purification; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus/immunology; Survival Rate",20210514.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22958-8,covidwho-1225507,2041-1723,1,Nat Commun,en,GB,2021.0,"Nat Commun;12(1): 2670, 2021 05 11.

"IMPORTANCE: The success in ending the COVID-19 pandemic rests partly on the mass uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine. Little work has been done to understand vaccine willingness among older adolescents and young adults. This is important since this age group may be less likely to adhere to public health guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To understand willingness of getting a vaccine and reasons for vaccine hesitancy among a sample of older adolescents and young adults. DESIGN: Data were from the Well-Being and Experiences study (The WE Study), a longitudinal community-based sample of older adolescents and young adults collected from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada from 2017 to 2020 (n?=?664). SETTING: The study setting was a community-based observational longitudinal study. PARTICIPANTS: Participants for the study were aged 14 to 17?years old at baseline in 2016-17 (n?=?1000). Data were also collected on one parent/caregiver. Waves 2 (n?=?747) and 3 (n?=?664) were collected in 2019 and 2020, respectively. EXPOSURES: The main exposures were sociodemographic factors, health conditions, COVID-19 knowledge, and adversity history. MAIN OUTCOMES: The main outcomes were COVID-19 vaccine willingness, hesitancy, and reasons for hesitancy. RESULTS: Willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine was 65.4%. Willingness did not differ by age, sex, or mental health conditions, but did differ for other sociodemographic characteristics, physical health conditions, COVID-19 knowledge, practicing social/physical distancing, and adversity history. The most common reasons for not wanting a vaccine were related to safety, knowledge, and effectiveness. Sex differences were noted. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Increasing uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine among older adolescents and young adults may rely on targeting individuals from households with lower income, financial burden, and adversity history, and generating public health messaging specifically aimed at vaccine safety, how it works to protect against illness, and why it is important to protect oneself against a COVID-19 infection.","Afifi, Tracie O; Salmon, Samantha; Taillieu, Tamara; Stewart-Tufescu, Ashley; Fortier, Janique; Driedger, S Michelle",,MEDLINE,COVID-19; Vaccines; Adolescent; COVID-19 Vaccines; Canada; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Manitoba; Pandemics; Public Health; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Young Adult,20210514.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.05.026,covidwho-1225426,1873-2518,26,Vaccine,en,NL,2021.0,"Vaccine;39(26): 3473-3479, 2021 06 11.

"AIM: The frequency of vaccine refusal and hesitation, which is associated with many factors, is increasing worldwide. The purpose of this study is to estimate the frequency of vaccine refusal against COVID-19 vaccines and to identify the underlying factors for refusal or hesitation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study carried out in a district of Istanbul from 25 to 30 December 2020. A sample of people from the ages of 20 to 85 in the district was selected, and a total of 384 people were enrolled. A questionnaire about the COVID-19 vaccine was administered to the participants by phone. The questionnaire consisted of questions about the sociodemographic characteristics of participants and their thoughts about possible COVID-19 vaccines. RESULTS: 45.3% of the participants were hesitant about getting the COVID-19 vaccine, which was declared appropriate by the Ministry of Health. The rate of those who think that the COVID-19 vaccine will be effective in preventing and controlling the disease was 51.6%. 89.6% of the participants were hesitant about getting their children vaccinated. Those who do not consider COVID-19 disease as a risk to their health were 22.9%, and 32.8% thought that they would be protected from the disease by natural and traditional ways. The median score of the participants&#039; risk perception was 7 (IQR: 6-8; Mean: 6.8; SD: 1.7). The median value of risk perception score of those who accept the vaccine was 6 (IQR: 4-6), while the median value for those who did not accept the vaccine was 4 (IQR: 4-6) (P?&lt;?.01). Factors affecting vaccine acceptance were determined as the perception of risk (OR: 1.26% 95CI 1.03-1.55) and age (OR: 0.94% 95CI: 0.91-0.98) in logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: Half of the participants were hesitant about the COVID-19 vaccines.

"AIM: Routine immunisation programmes are at risk of disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the resilience of the Swedish national immunisation programme for children up to the age of five years during the early stages of the pandemic. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, web-based survey of regional child health offices in Sweden between 10 September and 9 October 2020. It explored the organisation of child health services during the early stages of the pandemic, focusing on routine child immunisation. RESULTS: All 21 Swedish regional child health offices responded. They stated that child immunisation had been prioritised, communication with families had been intensified and there was greater flexibility at all organisational levels of child health services. In addition, the vaccine supply was sustained and child health centres remained open. However, there were periodic staff shortages, increased numbers of health visits cancelled by parents and most parent education groups were paused.

The change in willingness to vaccinate if the vaccine was safe and effective was not significant for those in Metropolitan Victoria;but was for those living in other Australian locations at survey 1 (OR = 2.13, 95%CI = 1.64, 2.76) and survey 2 (OR = 1.62, 95%CI = 1.30, 2.01), compared to survey 3. Willingness to vaccinate even if a vaccine had not been proven safe decreased at survey 3 (OR = 2.02, 95%CI = 1.14, 3.57) for those living in Metropolitan Victoria. In conclusion willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 decreased over time among Australians, except for those living in metropolitan Victoria, where an additional strict and prolonged lockdown was implemented around the time of survey 2. Either the experience of the lockdown, or the presence of the COVID-19 virus itself had a positive influence on participants¡¯ willingness to vaccinate, even if such a vaccine was not yet proven to be safe and effective.","To, Quyen G.; Stanton, Robert, Khalesi, Saman, Williams, Susan L.; Alley, Stephanie J.; Thwaite, Tanya L.; Fenning, Andrew S.; Vandelanotte, Corneel",,MDPI,,20210513.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9050479,covidwho-1224279,,5,Vaccines,en,,2021.0,"Vaccines; 9(5):479, 2021.","Willingness to Vaccinate against COVID-19 Declines in Australia, Except in Lockdown Areas",article,,,9
"Several COVID-19 vaccines have been on the market since early 2021 and may vary in their effectiveness and safety. This study characterizes hesitancy about accepting COVID-19 vaccines among parents in Shanghai, China, and identifies how sensitive they are to changes in vaccine safety and effectiveness profiles. Schools in each township of Minhang District, Shanghai, were sampled, and parents in the WeChat group of each school were asked to participate in this cross-sectional Internet-based survey. Parents responded to questions about hesitancy and were given information about five different COVID-19 vaccine candidates, the effectiveness of which varied between 50 and 95% and which had a risk of fever as a side effect between 5 and 20%. Overall, 3673 parents responded to the survey. Almost 90% would accept a vaccine for themselves (89.7%), for their child (87.5%) or for an elderly parent (88.5%) with the most ideal attributes (95% effectiveness with 5% risk of fever). But with the least ideal attributes (50% effectiveness and a 20% risk of fever) these numbers dropped to 33.5%, 31.3%, and 31.8%, respectively. Vaccine hesitancy, age at first child¡¯s birth, and relative income were all significantly related to sensitivity to vaccine safety and effectiveness. Parents showed a substantial shift in attitudes towards a vaccine based on its safety and effectiveness profile. These findings indicate that COVID-19 vaccine acceptance may be heavily influenced by how effective the vaccine actually is and could be impeded or enhanced based on vaccines already on the market.","Lu, Jia, Wen, Xiaosa, Guo, Qi, Ji, Mengdi, Zhang, Felicia, Wagner, Abram L.; Lu, Yihan",,MDPI,,20210513.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9050472,covidwho-1224275,,5,Vaccines,en,,2021.0,"Vaccines; 9(5):472, 2021.","Sensitivity to COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness and Safety in Shanghai, China",article,,,9
"In 2019, a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)) caused a global pandemic. There was an urgent need to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 to reduce its spread and economic burden. The main objective of this study was to understand the attitudes and concerns of healthcare workers (HCWs) towards the upcoming COVID-19 vaccine, whether their decision was influenced by their history of taking the seasonal influenza vaccine, and factors that influence the acceptance of the upcoming COVID-19 vaccine. This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We selected and surveyed 356 HCWs via an electronic self-administered questionnaire. A total of 61.16% of HCWs were willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and 55.9% of them had received the seasonal influenza vaccine in the preceding year (2019¨C2020). The strongest predictors for taking the COVID-19 vaccine were the HCWs¡¯ belief that the COVID-19 vaccine would be safe, needed even for healthy people, that all HCWs should be vaccinated against COVID-19, and that HCWs will have time to take the vaccine. Being female, being middle aged, having &amp;lt;5 years of work experience, having no fear of injections, and being a non-smoker were predictive factors for taking the upcoming COVID-19 vaccine. No associations were found between the intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine and a history of taking the seasonal influenza vaccine.","Baghdadi, Leena R.; Alghaihb, Shatha G.; Abuhaimed, Alanoud A.; Alkelabi, Dania M.; Alqahtani, Rawan S.",,MDPI,,20210513.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9050465,covidwho-1224270,,5,Vaccines,en,,2021.0,"Vaccines; 9(5):465, 2021.","Healthcare Workers¡¯ Perspectives on the Upcoming COVID-19 Vaccine in Terms of Their Exposure to the Influenza Vaccine in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study",article,,,9
"Background: Health care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of acquiring and transmitting COVID-19 infection. Moreover, they present role models for communities with regards to attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Hence, hesitancy of HCWs towards vaccination can crucially affect the efforts aiming to contain the pandemic. Previously published studies paid little attention to HCWs in Arab countries, which have a population of over 440 million. Objectives: To assess the rates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Arabic-speaking HCWs residing in and outside Arab countries, and their perceived barriers towards vaccination. Methods: A cross-sectional study based on an online survey was conducted from 14¨C29 January 2021, targeting Arabic-speaking HCWs from all around the world. Results: The survey recruited 5708 eligible participants (55.6% males, 44.4% females, age 30.6 ¡À 10 years) from 21 Arab countries (87.5%) and 54 other countries (12.5%). Our analysis showed a significant rate of vaccine hesitancy among Arabic-speaking HCWs residing in and outside of Arab countries (25.8% and 32.8%, respectively). The highest rates of hesitancy were among participants from the western regions of the Arab world (Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria). The most cited reasons for hesitancy were concerns about side effects and distrust of the expedited vaccine production and healthcare policies. Factors associated with higher hesitancy included age of 30¨C59, previous or current suspected or confirmed COVID-19, female gender, not knowing the vaccine type authorized in the participant¡¯s country, and not regularly receiving the influenza vaccine. Conclusion: This is the first large-scale multinational post-vaccine-availability study on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among HCWs. It reveals high rates of hesitancy among Arab-speaking HCWs. Unless addressed properly, this hesitancy can impede the efforts for achieving widespread vaccination and collective immunity.","Qunaibi, Eyad, Basheti, Iman, Soudy, Mohamed, Sultan, Iyad",,MDPI,,20210513.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9050446,covidwho-1224265,,5,Vaccines,en,,2021.0,"Vaccines; 9(5):446, 2021.",Hesitancy of Arab Healthcare Workers towards COVID-19 Vaccination: A Large-Scale Multinational Study,article,,,9
"Understanding the public¡¯s attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination and their acceptance could help facilitate the COVID-19 rollout. This study aimed to assess the acceptance and willingness to pay (WTP) for the COVID-19 vaccine among migrants in Shanghai, China. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 2126 migrants in Shanghai for the period 1¨C20 November 2020. Convenience sampling was used to recruit respondents in workplaces with large numbers of migrant workers. Multivariable (ordered) logistic regressions were used to examine factors associated with acceptance and WTP of the COVID-19 vaccine. Most (89.1%) migrants would accept COVID-19 vaccination. Over 90.0% perceived the COVID-19 vaccine as important, while only 75.0% and 77.7% perceived vaccines safe and effective. Socio-demographic factors were not significantly associated with vaccine acceptance, but confidence in the importance (OR 8.71, 95% CI 5.89¨C12.89), safety (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.24¨C2.61) and effectiveness (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.83¨C3.87) of COVID-19 vaccine was significantly positively associated with vaccine acceptance. The top reasons for vaccine hesitancy were lack of vaccine information and confidence. The proportion of those definitely willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine was 20% lower if paid by themselves than free vaccination. Migrants were willing to pay a median amount of USD 46 for the COVID-19 vaccine. Results show that a high acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine was universal among migrants in Shanghai. Concerns about vaccine safety, effectiveness and high costs of the COVID-19 vaccine may hinder their uptake. Effective health communication to build confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine and subsidies toward the costs of these vaccines are needed to improve uptake.","Han, Kaiyi, Francis, Mark R.; Zhang, Ruiyun, Wang, Qian, Xia, Aichen, Lu, Linyao, Yang, Bingyi, Hou, Zhiyuan",,MDPI,,20210513.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9050443,covidwho-1224263,,5,Vaccines,en,,2021.0,"Vaccines; 9(5):443, 2021.","Confidence, Acceptance and Willingness to Pay for the COVID-19 Vaccine among Migrants in Shanghai, China: A Cross-Sectional Study",article,,,9
"With the recent approval of highly effective COVID-19 vaccines, functional and lasting immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is currently under investigation as antibody levels in plasma were shown to decline during convalescence. Since the absence of antibodies does not equate to absence of immune memory, we evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B cells in convalescent individuals. Here we report a longitudinal assessment of humoral immune responses on 32 donors up to 8 months post-symptom onset. Our observations indicate that anti-Spike and anti-RBD IgM in plasma decay rapidly, whereas the reduction of IgG is less prominent. Neutralizing activity also declines rapidly when compared to Fc-effector functions. Concomitantly, the frequencies of RBD-specific IgM+ B cells wane significantly when compared to RBD-specific IgG+ B cells which remain stable. Our results add to the current understanding of immune memory following SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is critical for the prevention of secondary infections and vaccine efficacy.","Anand, Sai Priya; Pr¨¦vost, J¨¦r¨¦mie; Nayrac, Manon; Beaudoin-Bussi¨¨res, Guillaume; Benlarbi, Mehdi; Gasser, Romain; Brassard, Nathalie; Laumaea, Annemarie; Gong, Shang Yu; Bourassa, Catherine; Brunet-Ratnasingham, Elsa; Medjahed, Halima; Gendron-Lepage, Gabrielle; Goyette, Guillaume; Gokool, Laurie; Morrisseau, Chantal; B¨¦gin, Philippe; Martel-Laferri¨¨re, Val¨¦rie; Tremblay, C¨¦cile; Richard, Jonathan; Bazin, Ren¨¦e; Duerr, Ralf; Kaufmann, Daniel E; Finzi, Andr¨¦s",,MEDLINE,,20210512.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2021.100290,covidwho-1221069,2666-3791,,Cell Rep Med,en,US,2021.0,"Cell Rep Med;: 100290, 2021 May 05.

"Bacillus Calmette-Gu¨¦rin (BCG) is a live attenuated M. bovis vaccine that was developed about 100 years ago by Albert Calmette and Camille Gu¨¦rin. Many countries have been using the vaccine for decades against tuberculosis (TB). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a single dose of BCG for infants in TB endemic as well as leprosy high risk countries, and globally almost 130 million infants are vaccinated yearly. The role of BCG is well known in reducing neonatal and childhood death rates. Epidemiological and retrospective cross-sectional studies demonstrated that the BCG vaccination protects the children against respiratory tract infections and lowers the risk of malaria in children. In addition, BCG enhances IFN-?3 and IL-10 levels, thus providing immunity against respiratory tract infection even in elderly people. The BCG is also known to provide nonspecific innate immunity against viruses and parasites, through an innate immune mechanism termed &#039;trained immunity&#039; and is defined as the immunological recall of the innate immune system by epigenetic reprogramming. Based on these studies it is suggested that the BCG has the potential to act as a protective agent against COVID-19. Further proven safety records of BCG in humans, its adjuvant activity and low-cost manufacturing make it an attractive option to stop the pandemic and reduce the COVID-19 related mortality. In this review we discuss the heterologous effects of BCG, induction of trained immunity and its implication in development of a potential vaccine against COVID-19 pandemic.","Aspatwar, Ashok; Gong, Wenping; Wang, Shuyong; Wu, Xueqiong; Parkkila, Seppo",,MEDLINE,,20210511.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08830185.2021.1922685,covidwho-1218926,1563-5244,,Int Rev Immunol,en,GB,2021.0,"Int Rev Immunol;: 1-14, 2021 May 07.

"RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Little is known about hesitancy to receive the COVID-19 vaccines. The objectives of this study were (1) to assess the perceptions of healthcare workers (HCWs) and the general population regarding the COVID-19 vaccines, (2) to evaluate factors influencing the acceptance of vaccination using the health belief model (HBM), and (3) to qualitatively explore the suggested intervention strategies to promote the vaccination. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study based on electronic survey data that was collected in Iraq during December first-19th, 2020. The electronic survey was designed using Qualtrics. HBM was followed to develop the survey items. A regression analysis was used to identify factors influencing people accepting vaccination. Thematic analysis for participant comments to an open-ended question. RESULTS: A total of 1680 completed surveys were received. The mean age of 31.2 ¡À 9.9 years, 53.0% were female and 47.0% were male. The largest group was HCWs (45.7%), followed by general population (37.5%) and health college students (16.8%). Our findings expressed some hesitancy to receive the COVID-19 vaccine with the acceptance rate of 61.7%. The HCWs perceived significantly higher susceptibility and severity of the COVID-19 infection compared to the general population. The HCWs were significantly more likely than the general population to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Concerns with proper storage was the biggest barrier to vaccine receipt. The regression analysis indicated eight factors that were significantly associated with the willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine: Preventive measures, perceived benefit, perceived barriers, cue to action, subjective norm, supportive of vaccination in general and having received a flu vaccine before. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness campaign can focus on enhancing the vaccine perceived benefit, debunking misconceptions, and increasing the disease perceived severity. Additionally, the public health leaders need to minimize the perceived barriers by providing the vaccines and appeasing people concerns about their storage, effectiveness, and adverse events.","Al-Metwali, Basma Zuheir; Al-Jumaili, Ali Azeez; Al-Alag, Zahraa Adel; Sorofman, Bernard",,MEDLINE,,20210511.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jep.13581,covidwho-1218883,1365-2753,,J. eval. clin. pract.

"The factors that control the development of an effective immune response to the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus are poorly understood. In this study, we provide a cross-sectional analysis of the dynamics of B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We observe changes in B cell subsets consistent with a robust humoral immune response, including significant expansion of plasmablasts and activated receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific memory B cell populations. We observe elevated titers of Abs to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, full-length Spike, and nucleoprotein over the course of infection, with higher levels of RBD-specific IgG correlating with increased serum neutralization. Depletion of RBD-specific Abs from serum removed a major portion of neutralizing activity in most individuals. Some donors did retain significant residual neutralization activity, suggesting a potential Ab subset targeting non-RBD epitopes. Taken together, these findings are instructive for future vaccine design and mAb strategies.","Mantus, Grace; Nyhoff, Lindsay E; Kauffman, Robert C; Edara, Venkata Viswanadh; Lai, Lilin; Floyd, Katharine; Shi, Pei-Yong; Menachery, Vineet D; Edupuganti, Srilatha; Scherer, Erin M; Kay, Ariel; McNair, Nina; Anderson, Evan J; Rouphael, Nadine; Ahmed, Rafi; Suthar, Mehul S; Wrammert, Jens",,MEDLINE,"B-Lymphocytes/immunology; COVID-19/immunology; Immunity, Cellular; Immunologic Memory; Nucleocapsid Proteins/immunology; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus/immunology; Acute Disease; Cell Line; Female; Humans; Male; Protein Domains",20210510.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2001420,covidwho-1218655,1550-6606,11,J Immunol,en,US,2021.0,"J Immunol;206(11): 2605-2613, 2021 06 01.

"Background: Negative attitudes towards vaccines and an uncertainty or unwillingness to receive vaccinations are major barriers to managing the COVID-19 pandemic in the long-term. We estimate predictors of four domains of negative attitudes towards vaccines and identify groups most at risk of uncertainty and unwillingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in a large sample of UK adults. Methods: Data were cross-sectional and from 32,361 adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. Ordinary least squares regression analyses examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors on four types of negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial regression examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors, negative vaccine attitudes, and prior vaccine behaviour on uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Findings: 16% of respondents displayed high levels of mistrust about vaccines across one or more domains. Distrustful attitudes towards vaccination were higher amongst individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds, with lower levels of education, lower annual income, poor knowledge of COVID-19, and poor compliance with government COVID-19 guidelines. Overall, 14% of respondents reported unwillingness to receive a vaccine for COVID-19, whilst 23% were unsure. The largest predictors of both COVID-19 vaccine uncertainty and refusal were low-income groups (&amp;lt; 16,000, a year), having not received a flu vaccine last year, poor adherence to COVID-19 government guidelines, female gender, and living with children. Amongst vaccine attitudes, intermediate to high levels of mistrust of vaccine benefit and concerns about future unforeseen side effects were the most important determinants of both uncertainty and unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19. Interpretation: Negative attitudes towards vaccines are a major public health concern in the UK. General mistrust in vaccines and concerns about future side effects in particular will be barriers to achieving population immunity to COVID-19 through vaccination. Public health messaging should be tailored to address these concerns and specifically to women, ethnic minorities, and people with lower levels of education and incomes.

"OBJECTIVES: Vaccine hesitancy is a growing concern and threat to public health. This research will begin to examine the relative influence of relevant psychological, social, and situational factors on intent to engage with a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine among key workers and non-key workers. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. METHODS: The study utilized a sample of UK adults who completed the 1-month follow-up of The COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study during April/May 2020 and indicated having not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19 (key workers n?=?584; not key workers n?=?1,021). These groups were compared in relation to their intentions to vaccinate, perceived risk of infection, and symptom severity. Binary logistic regression was used to examine predictors of vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: Overall, 74.2% of the sample (76.2% key workers, 73.1% non-key workers) indicated they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine in future. Key workers (in particular health and social care workers) had a higher perceived risk of becoming infected in the coming months. For key workers, being female and perceiving oneself as having relatively low infection risk in the next 6?months was associated with increased likelihood of vaccine hesitancy. For non-key workers, however, being aged 25-54, having a low or average income and not knowing someone diagnosed with COVID-19 were associated with hesitancy. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of individuals willing to accept a vaccine is encouraging but there is much room for improvement.

"BACKGROUND: Vaccination is crucial to limit the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Therefore, besides the development and supply of vaccines, it is essential that sufficient individuals are willing to get vaccinated, but concerning proportions of populations worldwide show vaccine hesitancy. This makes it important to determine factors that are associated with vaccine acceptance. METHODS: 1779 adults of a non-probability convenience sample in Germany were assessed with an online survey in a cross-sectional survey period from 1st to 11th January 2021 (a few days after the beginning of vaccinations in Germany). RESULTS: 64.5% of the sample stated that they absolutely would accept the vaccination, 13.8% would rather accept it, 10.4% were undecided, and 5.2% would rather not and 6.0% absolutely not get vaccinated. COVID-19-related anxiety, and fears of infection and health-related consequences correlated significantly positively with vaccine acceptance (all p?&lt;?.001). In contrast, social (p?=?.006) and economic fears (p?&lt;?.001) showed significant negative associations with vaccination willingness. The broader constructs of unspecific anxiety and depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with vaccine acceptance. Vaccine acceptance differed between users/non-users of social media and official websites to gain information about the pandemic (p?&lt;?.001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-related anxiety and health-related fears were associated with higher vaccine acceptance, whereas the fear of social and economic consequences showed the contrary direction. These findings highlight the need to differentiate between several types of fears and anxiety to predict their influence on vaccine acceptance, and provide important information and an essential base for future studies and interventions.","Bendau, Antonia; Plag, Jens; Petzold, Moritz Bruno; Str?hle, Andreas",,MEDLINE,,20210507.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2021.107724,covidwho-1216348,1878-1705,,Int Immunopharmacol,en,NL,2021.0,"Int Immunopharmacol;97: 107724, 2021 Apr 27.

"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The success of the COVID-19 vaccination program is dependent on people&#039;s knowledge and attitude regarding the vaccination program. Higher vaccine acceptance can be ensured by strengthening the facilitators and limiting the barriers being observed among the general population.

RESULTS: A total of 1294 responses (age: 38.02?¡À?13.34 years) were collected. Most of the participants had limited knowledge regarding the eligibility of vaccines in vulnerable population groups such as people with allergies (57.89%) and immune-compromised patients (62.98%), pregnant and lactating women (41.89%) and patients with chronic illness (34.78%).

"BACKGROUND: The psychosocial impact of previous infectious disease outbreaks in adults has been well documented, however, there is limited information on the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults and children in the United Arab Emirate (UAE) community. The aim of this study was to explore anxiety levels among adults and children in the UAE and to identify potential risk and protective factors for well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey we collected data from 2200 self-selected, assessed volunteers and their children. Demographic information, knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using the (GAD-7) scale, emotional problems in children using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), worry and fear about COVID-19, coping mechanisms and general health information were collected. Descriptive analysis was carried out to summarize demographic and participant characteristics, Chi-square analysis to explore associations between categorical variables and anxiety levels and multivariable binary logistic regression analysis to determine predictors of anxiety levels in adults and emotional problems in children. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of GAD in the general population was 71% with younger people (59.8%) and females (51.7%) reporting highest levels of anxiety. Parents who were teachers reported the highest percentage of emotional problems in children (26.7%). Adjusted multivariable logistic regression for GAD-7 scores showed that being female, high levels of worry associated with COVID-19, intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine and smoking were associated with higher levels of anxiety. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression for SDQ showed that higher emotional problems were reported for children in lower and higher secondary education, and parents who had severe anxiety were seven times more likely to report emotional problems in their children.

"BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of COVID-19 and the time needed to develop a vaccine or definitive treatment for the disease have caused great anxiety in communities, especially in pregnant women whose high levels of distress may have short and/or long-term maternal and fetal consequence. This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between anxiety induced by COVID-19 and perceived social support in Iranian pregnant women. METHODS: This online cross-sectional study was conducted on 801 pregnant women from all over Iran in 2020. The data were collected using a demographic questionnaire, the multidimensional scale of perceived social support, and the coronavirus disease anxiety scale. A standard multiple linear regression model was used to identify the association between perceived social support and anxiety, controlling for possible confounding variables. Partial r was used as an estimate of effect size. RESULTS: The mean anxiety score was 10.7 ¡À 8.0, in which its level was moderate in 122 (15.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 12.8-17.9%)) of the participants, and severe in 28 (3.4%; 95% CI: 2.3-5.0%) of them. The mean score of perceived social support was 48.2 ¡À 7.6. 6.9% (95% CI: 5.2-8.8%) and 93.1% (95% CI: 91.2-94.8%) of the participants reported mild and moderate levels of perceived social support, respectively. The results of the multiple linear model showed a significant negative correlation between perceived social support and anxiety levels in a way that for every 10 units increase in the perceived social support score, the anxiety level of pregnant women was decreased by 0.8 units (B= -0.08, t= -2.08, p = 0.037), which was a small effect size (partial r = -0.07). CONCLUSION: There was a small significant relationship between the perceived social support and COVID-19 anxiety. Further studies are required to identify associated factors of anxiety level during COVID-19 in pregnant women.","Behmard, Vahideh; Bahri, Narjes; Mohammadzadeh, Fatemeh; Noghabi, Ali Delshad; Bahri, Nasrin",,MEDLINE,,20210506.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0167482X.2021.1918671,covidwho-1214032,1743-8942,,J Psychosom Obstet Gynaecol,en,GB,2021.0,"J Psychosom Obstet Gynaecol;: 1-8, 2021 May 04.

"BACKGROUND: The control of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may be dependent on widespread receipt of an effective vaccine. It is important to understand patient health-related behaviors and perceptions to guide public health vaccination strategies. OBJECTIVES: To examine perceptions of COVID-19 and vaccination beliefs, and identify predictors of intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in the US. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey guided by the Health Belief Model was conducted using a web-based Qualtrics survey panel of US adults. The main outcome was the intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine if offered. Additional measures included: demographics, perceptions of COVID-19 severity, risk and susceptibility, views of a potential COVID-19 vaccine, virus and vaccine information sources, vaccine beliefs and behaviors, and seasonal flu vaccine history. RESULTS: A total of 1047 complete responses were included. Females had lower odds of intending to receive the COVID-19 vaccine than males (AOR?=?0.54, 95% CI: 0.36-0.80). Those with a two-year degree/some college had lower odds of intending to receive the COVID-19 vaccine compared to those with a high school degree/GED (AOR?=?0.59, 95% CI: 0.36-0.97). Respondents who perceived the severity of the virus to be higher, perceived a greater COVID-19 vaccine benefit, and perceived greater general vaccine benefits had higher odds of intending to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (AOR?=?1.44, 95% CI: 1.09-1.91; AOR?=?2.82, 95% CI: 2.24-3.56; AOR?=?1.77, 95% CI 1.41-2.21, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine varied across demographics, perceived virus severity, COVID-19 vaccine and general vaccine beliefs. Successful implementation of a COVID-19 immunization strategy by healthcare providers and public health officials will need to incorporate diverse COVID-19 vaccination education strategies tailored to patients&#039; health beliefs.","Coe, Antoinette B; Elliott, Marissa H; Gatewood, Sharon B S; Goode, Jean-Venable R; Moczygemba, Leticia R",,MEDLINE,,20210506.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2021.04.023,covidwho-1213511,1934-8150,,Res. soc. adm. pharm,en,US,2021.0,Res Social Adm Pharm;2021 May 01. ,Perceptions and predictors of intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.,article,,,
"Background The time-concentrated nature of the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in England in March and April 2020 provides a natural experiment to measure changes in antibody positivity at the population level before onset of the second wave and initiation of the vaccination programme. Methods Three cross-sectional national surveys with non-overlapping random samples of the population in England undertaken between late June and September 2020 (REACT-2 study). 365,104 adults completed questionnaires and self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) tests for IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Findings Overall, 17,576 people had detectable antibodies, a prevalence of 4.9% (95% confidence intervals 4.9, 5.0) when adjusted for test characteristics and weighted to the adult population of England. The prevalence declined from 6.0% (5.8, 6.1), to 4.8% (4.7, 5.0) and 4.4% (4.3, 4.5), over the three rounds of the study a difference of -26.5% (-29.0, -23.8). The highest prevalence and smallest overall decline in positivity was in the youngest age group (18-24 years) at -14.9% (-21.6, -8.1), and lowest prevalence and largest decline in the oldest group (&amp;gt;74 years) at -39.0% (-50.8, -27.2). The decline from June to September 2020 was largest in those who did not report a history of COVID-19 at -64.0% (-75.6, -52.3), compared to -22.3% (-27.0, -17.7) in those with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed on PCR. Interpretation A large proportion of the population remained susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in England based on naturally acquired immunity from the first wave. Widespread vaccination is needed to confer immunity and control the epidemic at population level.

"Background: Public adherence to preventive measures, including flu vaccination, can lower complications from the disease and ultimately conserve health care resources. This study investigated the factors associated with older adults&#039; attitudes toward receiving the flu and the new COVID-19 vaccines, and the efficacy of an educational handout. Methods: A cross sectional study targeting older adults (¡Ý 65 years) presenting to the Senior Health clinic at MetroHealth Medical Center, Cleveland, for their appointments, during the flu vaccination campaign from October 2020 to February 2021. Targeted participants (n=400) filled an anonymous questionnaire that included their attitudes toward receiving both vaccines and the reasons for their decisions. Those who declined or were uncertain about getting the flu vaccine were given an educational handout summarizing the CDC recommendations for flu vaccination during COVID-19 pandemic. They were called in 4 weeks to inquire if they had reconsidered receiving it. Results: 72% of patients received or were planning to receive the flu shot. This is concordant with data from previous season. Among the identified factors for not receiving the vaccine, 90% never get their flu shot, 84% lacked knowledge of its necessity, while 68% think that the current preventive measures will protect them against both viruses. Only 6% attributed their hesitancy to co-existing COVID-19 virus. At 4 weeks follow up call, 20% reconsidered taking the flu vaccine. Moreover, only 13% of all participants considered receiving the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available. Whereas, the majority (75%) were uncertain about getting it. Among them, 77% chose to watchfully wait, others had concerns of side effects (11%) or preferred to discuss it with their doctors (12%). Of those against the vaccine, 90% were dubious about its production. Conclusion: The majority of patients queried were knowledgeable about the importance of the flu vaccination. However, data showed concerning hesitancy about receiving the novel COVID-19 vaccine. The COVID-19 pandemic does not seem to influence their decisions to receive both vaccines. Overall, our intervention was 8% effective in changing patients&#039; choices to get the flu vaccine. More comprehensive health education strategies are needed to target this particularly vulnerable population.","Tarabay, R.; Al Aridi, R.; Corrigan, M.",,EMBASE,,20210506.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17115,covidwho-1214912,,SUPPL 1,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,en,,2021.0,"Journal of the American Geriatrics Society; 69(SUPPL 1):S50, 2021.",Knowledge and attitude of older adults toward getting the seasonal flu and the novel COVID-19 vaccines: A cross-sectional study,article,,,69
"BACKGROUND: Patients with Parkinson&#039;s disease (PD) are at higher risk of vaccine-preventable respiratory infections. However, advanced, homebound individuals may have less access to vaccinations. In light of COVID-19, understanding barriers to vaccination in PD may inform strategies to increase vaccine uptake. OBJECTIVE: To identify influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates, including barriers and facilitators to vaccination, among homebound and ambulatory individuals with PD and related disorders. METHODS: Cross-sectional US-based study among individuals with PD, ageda??&gt;a??65 years, stratified as homebound or ambulatory. Participants completed semi-structured interviews on vaccination rates and barriers, and healthcare utilization. RESULTS: Among 143 participants, 9.8% had missed all influenza vaccinations in the past 5 years, and 32.2% lacked any pneumococcal vaccination, with no between-group differences. Homebound participants (na??=a??41) reported difficulty traveling to clinic (pa??&lt;a??0.01) as a vaccination barrier, and despite similar outpatient visit frequencies, had more frequent emergency department visits (31.7% vs. 9.8%, pa??&lt;a??0.01) and hospitalizations (14.6% vs. 2.9%, pa??=a??0.03). Vaccine hesitancy was reported in 35% of participants, vaccine refusal in 19%, and 13.3% reported unvaccinated household members, with no between-group differences. Nearly 13% thought providers recommended against vaccines for PD patients, and 31.5% were unsure of vaccine recommendations in PD. CONCLUSION: Among a sample of homebound and ambulatory people with PD, many lack age-appropriate immunizations despite ample healthcare utilization. Many participants were unsure whether healthcare providers recommend vaccinations for people with PD. In light of COVID-19, neurologist reinforcement that vaccinations are indicated, safe, and recommended may be beneficial.","Phanhdone, Tiffany; Drummond, Patrick; Meisel, Talia; Friede, Naomi; Di Rocco, Alessandro; Chodosh, Joshua; Fleisher, Jori",,MEDLINE,,20210505.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JPD-202497,covidwho-1211799,1877-718X,,Journal of Parkinson&#039;s disease (Online),en,NL,2021.0,J Parkinsons Dis;2021 Apr 30. ,Barriers to Vaccination Among People with Parkinson&#039;s Disease and Implications for COVID-19.,article,,,
"OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between factors based on the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) and behavioral intention of free and self-paid (600 RMB or 91 USD) COVID-19 vaccination of 80% effectiveness and rare mild side effects among doctors and nurses in China. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Public hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 362 doctors and 1702 nurses in major departments of five hospitals of three Chinese provinces. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was conducted from October to November 2020, facilitated by hospital administrators through online WeChat/QQ working groups. Data on outcome expectations, self-efficacy, norms, and COVID-19-related work experiences were collected. Multivariate logistic regression models were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The logistic regression analysis showed that physical (e.g., protective effect of vaccination) and self-evaluative outcome expectations (e.g., anticipated regret), self-efficacy, norms (e.g., descriptive norm, subjective norm, professional norm, and moral norm), and job satisfaction were significantly and positively associated with the free and self-paid COVID-19 vaccination intention outcomes among doctors and nurses, adjusted for background variables. Doctors who had engaged in COVID-19-related work reported higher self-paid vaccination intention. CONCLUSIONS: Health promotion is needed to improve the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare workers. Such interventions may consider modifying the identified factors of vaccination intention, including strengthening perceived efficacy, positive feelings about vaccination, the need to avoid future regret, self-efficacy, and social norms. Future studies should examine the actual behavior patterns of COVID-19 vaccination and testing the efficacy of promotion intervention through randomized controlled studies.","She, Rui; Chen, Xi; Li, Liping; Li, Lijuan; Huang, Zepeng; Lau, Joseph T F",,MEDLINE,,20210505.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/ice.2021.201,covidwho-1211246,1559-6834,,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,en,US,2021.0,"Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol;: 1-25, 2021 May 03.

"SARS-CoV-2 vaccine rollout has coincided with the spread of variants of concern. We investigated if single dose vaccination, with or without prior infection, confers cross protective immunity to variants. We analyzed T and B cell responses after first dose vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 in healthcare workers (HCW) followed longitudinally, with or without prior Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 infection. After one dose, individuals with prior infection showed enhanced T cell immunity, antibody secreting memory B cell response to spike and neutralizing antibodies effective against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. By comparison, HCW receiving one vaccine dose without prior infection showed reduced immunity against variants. B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 spike mutations resulted in increased, abrogated or unchanged T cell responses depending on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms. Single dose vaccination with BNT162b2 in the context of prior infection with a heterologous variant substantially enhances neutralizing antibody responses against variants.","Reynolds, Catherine J; Pade, Corinna; Gibbons, Joseph M; Butler, David K; Otter, Ashley D; Menacho, Katia; Fontana, Marianna; Smit, Angelique; Sackville-West, Jane E; Cutino-Moguel, Teresa; Maini, Mala K; Chain, Benjamin; Noursadeghi, Mahdad; Brooks, Tim; Semper, Amanda; Manisty, Charlotte; Treibel, Thomas A; Moon, James C; Valdes, Ana M; McKnight, ¨¢ine; Altmann, Daniel M; Boyton, Rosemary",,MEDLINE,,20210504.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.abh1282,covidwho-1209815,1095-9203,,Science (Wash.),en,US,2021.0,Science;2021 Apr 30. ,Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection rescues B and T cell responses to variants after first vaccine dose.,article,,,
"There are concerns regarding the side effects of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA-1273 vaccine among healthcare workers (HCWs) in the United States. The objective of the study was to investigate the side effects of the mRNA-1273 vaccine with detailed review of organ systems. A randomized, cross-sectional study using an independent online survey questionnaire was conducted to collect responses from HCWs. Of all participants, 87.8% (1116/1271) provided complete responses. Of them, 38.7% (432/1116) received the mRNA-1273 vaccine, among which, 89.35% were females; 425 of these 432 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients (98.34%) reported at least one or more symptoms. The results were classified based on the frequency of symptoms reported postvaccination. Of these, 254/432 (58.8%) were able to continue their daily routine activities. 108/432 (25%) temporarily had trouble to perform daily activities, 120/432 (27.78%) required transient time off from work, 17/432 (3.94%) required help from an outpatient provider, 1/432 (0.23%) required help from emergency department, and none of them were hospitalized. Despite the wide array of self-reported symptoms, 97.02% of the HCWs did not intend to skip the second dose of vaccine. Among all the symptoms reported, localized pain, generalized weakness, headache, myalgia, chills, fever, nausea, joint pains, sweating, localized swelling at the injection site, dizziness, itching, rash, decreased appetite, muscle spasm, decreased sleep quality, and brain fogging were the most commonly reported symptoms (in descending order of occurrence). Most of the symptoms reported were nonlife threatening. Despite the wide array of self-reported symptoms, there appears to be a higher acceptance for this vaccine.","Kadali, Renuka Ananth Kalyan; Janagama, Ravali; Peruru, Sharanya; Gajula, Viswanath; Madathala, Rajasekhar R; Chennaiahgari, Nikhita; Malayala, Srikrishna V",,MEDLINE,COVID-19 Vaccines/adverse effects; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Health Personnel/psychology; Injection Site Reaction/pathology; Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Aged; Anaphylaxis/pathology; COVID-19/immunology; COVID-19 Vaccines/immunology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Fever; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; Self Report; Sick Leave/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult,20210504.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26996,covidwho-1209630,1096-9071,7,J Med Virol,en,US,2021.0,"J Med Virol;93(7): 4420-4429, 2021 Jul.

"BACKGROUND: Influenza is a major public health issue, with the primary preventive measure being an annual influenza vaccination. Nevertheless, vaccination coverage among the at-risk population is low. Our understanding of the behaviour of the influenza virus during the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic is limited, meaning influenza vaccination is still recommended for individuals at risk for severe complications due to influenza infection. The aim of the study is to determine the intention to vaccinate against seasonal influenza among the at-risk population in the 2020-21 campaign during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and to analyse the factors which influence such intention. METHODS: Cross-sectional telephone survey of adults (aged over 18) with risk factors in central Catalonia where the need for the Seasonal Influenza Vaccine (SIV) was recommended. RESULTS: A total of 434 participants responded to the survey, 43.3% of whom intended to be vaccinated against influenza for the 2020-2021 influenza season, 40.8% had no intention to be vaccinated and 15.9% were uncertain or did not express their opinion. The intention to get vaccinated against influenza is associated with having dependents, the individual&#039;s perception of the risk of being infected with influenza and the perceived risk of transmission to dependents. It is also associated with age, whether the individual had received influenza vaccine the previous season or any other season before. The best predictors of the intention to vaccinate are the individual&#039;s perception of the risk of catching influenza and whether the individual had been vaccinated in the previous season. CONCLUSIONS: Intention to vaccinate can be a good predictor of individual behaviour in relation to vaccination. During the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic many individuals are hesitant to influenza vaccination. In order to improve influenza vaccination coverage in people included in risk groups, it is necessary to promote educational actions, especially among those who express doubts.","Bonet-Esteve, Anna; Mu?oz-Miralles, Raquel; Gonzalez-Claramunt, Carla; Rufas, Ana M; Cruz, Xavier Pelegrin; Vidal-Alaball, Josep",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/epidemiology; Influenza Vaccines/therapeutic use; Influenza, Human; Intention; Mass Vaccination; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Influenza, Human/epidemiology; Influenza, Human/prevention &amp;amp; control; Male; Mass Vaccination/methods; Mass Vaccination/psychology; Mass Vaccination/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Middle Aged; SARS-CoV-2; Social Perception; Spain/epidemiology; Vaccination Coverage/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Vaccination Refusal/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data",20210504.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12875-021-01434-8,covidwho-1209389,1471-2296,1,BMC Fam Pract,en,GB,2021.0,"BMC Fam Pract;22(1): 84, 2021 05 01.

"BACKGROUND: Determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers (HCW) remains poorly understood. We assessed HCWs&#039; willingness to be vaccinated?and reasons underlying hesitancy. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey across 17 healthcare institutions. HCWs eligible for vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA) in December 2020 were invited to receive immunization. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of acceptance. Reasons for refusal among those who never intended to be vaccinated (ie, firm refusers) and those who preferred delaying vaccination (ie, vaccine hesitants) were assessed. RESULTS: Among 2,761 respondents (72% female, average age, 44), 2,233 (80.9%) accepted?the vaccine. Physicians, environmental services workers and healthcare managers were more likely to accept vaccination compared to nurses. Male sex, age over 50, rehabilitation center workers, and occupational COVID-19 exposure were independently associated with vaccine acceptance by multivariate analysis. Factors for refusal?included vaccine novelty, wanting others to receive it first,?and insufficient time for decision-making. Among those who declined, 74% reported they may accept future vaccination. Vaccine firm refusers were more likely than vaccine hesitants to distrust pharmaceutical companies and to prefer developing a natural immunity by getting COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine hesitancy exists among HCWs. Our findings provide useful information to plan future interventions and improve acceptance.","Dzieciolowska, Stefania; Hamel, Denis; Gadio, Souleymane; Dionne, Maude; Gagnon, Dominique; Robitaille, Lucie; Cook, Erin; Caron, Isabelle; Talib, Amina; Parkes, Leighanne; Dub¨¦, ¨¨ve; Longtin, Yves",,MEDLINE,,20210504.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2021.04.079,covidwho-1208791,1527-3296,,Am. j. infect. control,en,US,2021.0,Am J Infect Control;2021 Apr 28. ,"Covid-19 vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, and refusal among Canadian healthcare workers: A multicenter survey.",article,,,
"BACKGROUND: The degree to which children experience unmet need for dental care during the COVID-19 pandemic and its association with pandemic-related household job or income loss are unknown. METHODS: The authors performed a cross-sectional household survey of 348 families in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from June 25 through July 2, 2020. Unmet need for child dental care and pandemic-related household job or income loss were assessed using caregiver self-report. RESULTS: Caregivers reported that the greatest unmet child health care need during the COVID-19 pandemic was dental care (16%), followed by medical care for a well visit or vaccination (5%). Approximately 40% of caregivers reported job loss or a decrease in household income due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors found a significant association between the probability of unmet child dental care and pandemic-related household job or income loss (P = .022). Losing a job or experiencing a decrease in income due to the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with unmet child dental care (relative risk, 1.77;95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 2.88). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample, 3 times as many households reported unmet dental care for a child compared with unmet medical care. Unmet child dental care was more common in households where pandemic-related job or income loss occurred. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: If unmet dental care continues as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, nontraditional strategies for delivering dental care can be considered to improve access to dental care for children, such as teledentistry and oral health prevention services in primary care settings.","Burgette, J.

"Background/Objective: The outbreak of COVID-19 and the lack of vaccine made extraordinary actions such as social distancing necessary. While some individuals experience the restrictions on daily life as a heavy burden, others adapt to the situation and try to make the best of it. The present longitudinal study investigated the extent and predictors of the burden induced by the outbreak of COVID-19 in Germany. Method: Data were assessed in October 2019 using the DASS-21 and the PMH-Scale, and in March 2020 adding a six-item measure of burden and a 2-item rating of sense of control. Results: In a sample of 436 participants, about 28% stayed in self-quarantine, 22 persons had relevant symptoms and one person was positively tested for COVID-19. Most participants experienced medium to high levels of burden but tried to make the best of it. Stress symptoms in 2019 predicted a higher level of burden and PMH predicted a lower level of burden in March 2020. Remarkably, depression and anxiety symptoms did not significantly predict burden.

"Vaccine hesitancy is a major threat to the success of COVID-19 vaccination programs. The present cross-sectional online survey of adult Poles (n = 1020) expressing a willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was conducted between February and March 2021 and aimed to assess (i) the general trust in different types of vaccines, (ii) the level of acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines already in use in Poland (BNT162b2 by BioNTech/Pfizer, mRNA-1273 by Moderna and AZD1222 by Oxford/AstraZeneca) as well as eight vaccines approved outside European Union (EU) or in advanced stages of clinical trials, (iii) level of fear of vaccination against COVID-19, and (iv) main sources of information on COVID-19 vaccination. Among all major vaccine technology, the highest level of trust was observed for the mRNA platform, with a considerable number of surveyed (&amp;gt;20%) not aware of the existence of vaccines produced using the traditional approach (inactivated and live attenuated vaccines). The age of participants was the main factor differentiating the level of trust in a particular vaccine type. Both BNT162b and mRNA-1273 received a high level of acceptance, contrary to AZD1222. From eight vaccines unauthorized in the EU at the moment of study, the CVnCoV (mRNA;CureVac) was met with the highest level of trust, followed by Ad26.COV2.S (vector;Janssen/Johnson&amp;Johnson) and NVX-CoV2373 (protein;Novavax). Sputnik V (vector;Gamaleya Research Institute) was decidedly the least trusted vaccine. The median level of fear (measured by the 10-point Likert-type scale) in the studied group was 4.0, mostly related to the risk of serious allergic reactions, other severe adverse events and unknown long-term effects of vaccination. Female, individuals with a lower level of education and those not seeking any information on the COVID-19 vaccines revealed a higher fear of vaccination. Experts&#039; materials were the major source of information on COVID-19 vaccines in the studied group. The study shows the level of trust in COVID-19 vaccines can vary much across the producers while the mRNA vaccines are received with a high level of acceptance. It also emphasizes the need for effective and continuous science communication when fighting the pandemic as it may be an ideal time to increase the general awareness of vaccines.","Rzymski, P.; Zeyland, J.; Poniedzialek, B.; Malecka, I.; Wysocki, J.",,MEDLINE,,20210504.0,https://10.3390/vaccines9040382,covidwho-1209722,,4,Vaccines (Basel),en,,2021.0,"Vaccines (Basel); 9(4):14, 2021.",The Perception and Attitudes toward COVID-19 Vaccines: A Cross-Sectional Study in Poland,article,,,9
"Differences in obtaining a vaccine vary based on a multitude of factors including perceptions of vaccine safety, efficacy and willingness to pay (WTP). This study focuses on parent perceptions toward a vaccine for COVID-19 including their WTP decisions for their children and themselves. A mixed methods design using a cross-sectional survey was used to assess the perceptions of US parents, with children under 18, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was administered online in November 2020 and 584 final responses were collected. The questionnaire consisted of approximately 37 closed and open-ended questions regarding personal background information;awareness, knowledge, and experience of the virus;perception toward vaccines and COVID-19;and the contingent valuation of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. WTP was found to be higher for children and a direct relationship between the number of children and WTP was observed. Parents were willing to pay US$228-$291 for a vaccine for themselves and US$243-US$321 for their children. A positive impact on WTP was found with self-reported parent health status but not children. The findings of this study have important implications for policy programs which require detailed cost-benefit analyses. WTP for a COVID-19 vaccine is crucial to determine the partial benefits of vaccinating to reduce the risk of repetitive widespread outbreaks.","Catma, S.; Reindl, D.",,MEDLINE,,20210504.0,https://10.1080/21645515.2021.1919453,covidwho-1209698,,,Human vaccines &amp; Immunotherapeutics,en,,2021.0,"Human vaccines &amp; Immunotherapeutics;: 1-7, 2021.",Parents&#039; willingness to pay for a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children in the United States,article,,,
"The current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). A better understanding of its immunogenicity can be important for the development of improved diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Here, we report the longitudinal analysis of three COVID-19 patients with moderate (#1) and mild disease (#2 and #3). Antibody serum responses were analyzed using spike glycoprotein enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), full-proteome peptide, and glycan microarrays. ELISA immunoglobulin A, G, and M (IgA, IgG, and IgM) signals increased over time for individuals #1 and #2, whereas #3 only showed no clear positive IgG and IgM result. In contrast, peptide microarrays showed increasing IgA/G signal intensity and epitope spread only in the moderate patient #1 over time, whereas early but transient IgA and stable IgG responses were observed in the two mild cases #2 and #3. Glycan arrays showed an interaction of antibodies to fragments of high-mannose and core N-glycans, present on the viral shield. In contrast to protein ELISA, microarrays allow for a deeper understanding of IgA, IgG, and IgM antibody responses to specific epitopes of the whole proteome and glycans of SARS-CoV-2 in parallel. In the future, this may help to better understand and to monitor vaccination programs and monoclonal antibodies as therapeutics.","Heidepriem, J.; Dahlke, C.; Kobbe, R.; Santer, R.; Koch, T.; Fathi, A.; Seco, B.

"This study aimed to evaluate the acceptability of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination among ophthalmology residents in Poland. An online, self-administered, anonymous survey was distributed among Polish ophthalmology residents in early 2021. Of 126 residents who completed the survey, 71.4% indicated that they would get vaccinated, 17.5% were unsure, and 11.1% would refuse vaccination. Married respondents with children (p = 0.036) and respondents living with their families (p = 0.310) were more likely to accept vaccination, believing that the vaccine is effective (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively), and fearing for themselves (p = 0.031 and p = 0.023, respectively) or their families (p = 0.032 and 0.055, respectively) getting infected. Respondents who contracted COVID-19 often reported the expected relief in sanitization (p = 0.011) as their reason for vaccination, and the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (p = 0.050) as their reason for not vaccinating. Unmarried residents and residents living alone often declared that they were waiting for the effectiveness and long-term complications of the vaccine to be assessed (p = 0.005, both). Residents living with their families were significantly less likely to report COVID-19 as the reason for refusing vaccination (p = 0.022). In conclusion, most ophthalmology residents expressed a willingness to get vaccinated. Marital status and cohabitants affect vaccination acceptance. People with COVID-19 have different reasons for accepting or refusing vaccination. Medical authorities should persuade citizens more to vaccinate.","Konopinska, J.; Obuchowska, I.; Lisowski, L.; Dub, N.; Kozera, M.; Rekas, M.",,MEDLINE,,20210504.0,https://10.3390/vaccines9040371,covidwho-1209408,,4,Vaccines (Basel),en,,2021.0,"Vaccines (Basel); 9(4):11, 2021.",Intention to Get COVID-19 Vaccinations among Ophthalmology Residents in Poland: A Cross-Sectional Survey,article,,,9
"In January 2021, Israel started vaccinating healthcare workers (HCWs) and individuals older than 65 years with COVID-19 vaccines. Scientific literature points to vaccine hesitancy as being a major health concern. During time of pandemics, increased consciousness of health behaviors may be encountered. The current study aimed to assess attitudes to general vaccines and to COVID-19 vaccines in particular among adult (&amp;gt;18) Israeli general public, and among Israeli dentists and dental hygienists. Cross-sectional surveys were filled out by a total of 501 participants (361 Israeli adults &amp;gt;18 years, 73 dental hygienists, and 67 dentists). Along with basic demographics, participants responded to the Hebrew VAX, COVID-VAX and HCS scales. Group comparisons were analyzed using t tests and ANOVAs with Scheffe&#039;s test used for post hoc comparisons. Dental hygienists demonstrated significantly higher anti-vaccinations approaches than both dentists (p &amp;lt; 0.01) and the general public (p &amp;lt; 0.05). In all groups, attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccines were more negative compared to attitudes towards general vaccines, with hygienists demonstrating significant negative attitudes compared to dentists (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The general public (p = 0.56) and hygienists demonstrated increased health awareness compared to dentists (p &amp;lt; 0.05). As health awareness has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic primary strategies to combat vaccine hesitancy should be implemented in the general public, and in particular, an dental teams.","Shacham, M.; Greenblatt-Kimron, L.; Hamama-Raz, Y.; Martin, L.

"mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines offer a preventive strategy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections that is of interest in the care of patients on hemodialysis (HDP). We measured humoral immune responses in 72 HDP after standard vaccination with two doses of the mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech). Antibody responses were evaluated with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ChemiLuminescent ImmunoAssay (CLIA) two weeks after the second dose. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 IgG was determined in a control of 16 healthy healthcare workers (HCW). The control group of HCW has shown a strong antibody response with a median (MD (Q1;Q3)) antibody titer of 800.0 AU/mL (520.5;800.0). In comparison to HCW, HDP under 60 years of age responded equally (597.0 AU/mL (410.5;800.0), p = 0.051). However, the antibody responses of the HDP negatively correlated with age (r&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; = 0.2954 p &amp;lt; 0.0001), leading to significantly lower antibody titers in HDP over 60 years (280.0 AU/mL (45.7;477.0), p &amp;lt; 0.0001). To thoroughly understand the immunogenicity of the new mRNA-based vaccines in HDP, longitudinal data on the effectiveness and durability of antibody responses are needed. Modifications of immunization schedules should be considered in HDP with low or without antibody responsiveness after standard vaccination to boost immune reactivity and prolong protective effects in these vulnerable patients.","Jahn, M.; Korth, J.; Dorsch, O.; Anastasiou, O.

"Secondary or high school (HS) educational professionals expressed concerns about dealing with environmental and occupational health and safety protocols due to COVID-19. Concerns related to fall 2020 school re-opening and getting back into in-person teaching-whether full-time, part-time or some other approved hybrid model-plus ongoing uncertainty with how the state and federal government will be handling matters about mandates for virtual learning, rapid testing, vaccine distribution, etc. These concerns were related to both their experience as educational professionals and genuine interest in personal and student well-being. This study was a cross-sectional online survey in early fall from mid-September-early October 2020. Of a possible maximum participation of 740 New Jersey (NJ) supervisory-level HS teachers and administrators (e.g., department chairs, district and school principals), 100 confirmed unique respondents (13.5%) consented and completed the survey. Of 100 experienced (mean 18 years teaching) participants, 70% responded to the gender identity question (overall, 61% female, 39% male;by NJ region, gender ratios were similar). There were statistically significant differences (using Fischer&#039;s exact test) between NJ regions regarding provision of online counseling and support services for teachers (p &amp;lt; 0.001);for resources and equipment for teachers to mediate online learning (p = 0.02);for assistive video technology tools (p = 0.03) and accessibility to structured online learning and professional development (p = 0.002);concerning learning aids to engage students in online instruction, online counseling, and support services for students and their families (p = 0.006);appropriate protocol is clean and disinfect areas used by a person with COVID-19 (p = 0.002);and, immediately separate staff and students who screen positive for COVID-19 (p = 0.03). There were few statistical differences by gender. This study reported what participants wanted regarding the development of future policies then implemented as reopening practices.

"The purpose of our study was to determine the willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and factors associated with vaccine hesitancy among people with epilepsy (PWE). In December 2020, we performed an online cross-sectional survey of PWE and their caregivers in Lithuania before the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines to the public. The study sample consisted of 111 respondents (44 (39.6%) male, median age 25 years (range 1 to 70)). From 58 PWE who personally responded to the survey, 27 (46.6%) would be willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Among the 53 caregivers, 18 (34.0%) would accept the person they care for to be vaccinated. Willingness to be vaccinated was associated with receiving an influenza shot in 2020 (odds ratio (OR) = 9.17, 95% confidence interval (CI = 1.15-73.47), the beliefs that vaccines are generally safe (OR = 7.90, 95% CI = 2.43-25.74) and that they are the only convenient way to gain immunity (OR = 3.91, 95% CI = 1.02-15.05). Respondents were hesitant to accept the COVID-19 vaccine if they thought it could cause the infection (OR = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.04-0.49). COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is frequent among PWE and their caregivers. It is probably related to erroneous beliefs about their safety and mechanism of action.","Puteikis, K.; Mameniskiene, R.",,MEDLINE,,20210504.0,https://10.3390/ijerph18084374,covidwho-1209109,,8,International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],en,,2021.0,"International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource]; 18(8):20, 2021.",Factors Associated with COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy among People with Epilepsy in Lithuania,article,,,18
"In March 2021, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic still poses a threat to the global population, and is a public health challenge that needs to be overcome. Now more than ever, action is needed to tackle vaccine hesitancy, especially in light of the availability of effective and safe vaccines. A cross-sectional online survey was carried out on a representative random sample of 1011 citizens from the Emilia-Romagna region, in Italy, in January 2021. The questionnaire collected information on socio-demographics, comorbidities, past vaccination refusal, COVID-19-related experiences, risk perception of infection, and likelihood to accept COVID-19 vaccination. Multiple logistic regression analyses and classification tree analyses were performed to identify significant predictors of vaccine hesitancy and to distinguish groups with different levels of hesitancy. Overall, 31.1% of the sample reported hesitancy. Past vaccination refusal was the key discriminating variable followed by perceived risk of infection. Other significant predictors of hesitancy were: ages between 35 and 54 years, female gender, low educational level, low income, and absence of comorbidities. The most common concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine involved safety (54%) and efficacy (27%). Studying the main determinants of vaccine hesitancy can help with targeting vaccination strategies, in order to gain widespread acceptance-a key path to ensure a rapid way out of the current pandemic emergency.","Reno, C.; Maietti, E.; Fantini, M.

A small minority of the participants had already received the vaccine (2.1%), while 20.3% had registered in the Sehaty app (application) to receive the vaccine. Just under half of them (48%) will take the vaccine when mass vaccination is achieved and approximately the same number (46.7%) will only take it if it is made mandatory.

"Background: Global efforts toward the development and deployment of a vaccine for COVID-19 are rapidly advancing. To achieve herd immunity, widespread administration of vaccines is required, which necessitates significant cooperation from the general public. As such, it is crucial that governments and public health agencies understand public sentiments toward vaccines, which can help guide educational campaigns and other targeted policy interventions. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and apply an artificial intelligence¨Cbased approach to analyze public sentiments on social media in the United Kingdom and the United States toward COVID-19 vaccines to better understand the public attitude and concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: Over 300,000 social media posts related to COVID-19 vaccines were extracted, including 23,571 Facebook posts from the United Kingdom and 144,864 from the United States, along with 40,268 tweets from the United Kingdom and 98,385 from the United States from March 1 to November 22, 2020. We used natural language processing and deep learning¨Cbased techniques to predict average sentiments, sentiment trends, and topics of discussion. These factors were analyzed longitudinally and geospatially, and manual reading of randomly selected posts on points of interest helped identify underlying themes and validated insights from the analysis. Results: Overall averaged positive, negative, and neutral sentiments were at 58%, 22%, and 17% in the United Kingdom, compared to 56%, 24%, and 18% in the United States, respectively. Public optimism over vaccine development, effectiveness, and trials as well as concerns over their safety, economic viability, and corporation control were identified. We compared our findings to those of nationwide surveys in both countries and found them to correlate broadly. Conclusions: Artificial intelligence¨Cenabled social media analysis should be considered for adoption by institutions and governments alongside surveys and other conventional methods of assessing public attitude. Such analyses could enable real-time assessment, at scale, of public confidence and trust in COVID-19 vaccines, help address the concerns of vaccine sceptics, and help develop more effective policies and communication strategies to maximize uptake.","Hussain, Amir, Tahir, Ahsen, Hussain, Zain, Sheikh, Zakariya, Gogate, Mandar, Dashtipour, Kia, Azhar, Ali, Sheikh, Aziz",,ProQuest Central,,20210504.0,http://10.2196/26627,covidwho-1208472,,4,Journal of Medical Internet Research,en,,2021.0,"Journal of Medical Internet Research; 23(4), 2021.",Artificial Intelligence¨CEnabled Analysis of Public Attitudes on Facebook and Twitter Toward COVID-19 Vaccines in the United Kingdom and the United States: Observational Study,article,,,23
"Background The pandemic of COVID-19 continues to grow all over the world. At present COVID ¨C 19 vaccine provides the finest anticipation to control the pandemic of COVID-19. Currently, different types of vaccines are available to control Caronavirus disease. Nevertheless, to check the effectiveness and accuracy of vaccines, people need to be accepted to take the vaccine. The objective of this study is to assess the awareness, opinion, and acceptance of the COVID ¨C 19 disease vaccines. Materials and methods An online-based cross-sectional design was conducted. The sample size was 156 who were aged above 18 years. These samples were chosen by using the snow ball sampling technique. The measurement scale was sent on WhatsApp of the participants by using google form. A total of 156 samples have responded to questionnaires. A panel of experts was involved for validation. The measurement scale had mainly evaluated the knowledge, opinion, and acceptance of the participants to the COVID-19 vaccine. The data was analyzed by checking the frequency and percentages, and standard deviation. Results Approximately 58 % to 82% of participants were aware of actual symptoms of COVID-19, nearly 72 % to 90 % of participants answered that COVID-19 infection is transmitted by inhalation of respiratory droplets of an infected person and taking uncleaned food and water. In addition to the above results, the majority of the participants aware of wearing a mask, keeping social distance, and frequent sanitization can reduce the contraction of COVID-19 infection. Unpredictably 64.10 % of samples were not willing to take COVID-19 vaccine while 42.95 % of subjects said they don¡¯t even suggest their friends and relatives take this vaccine. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that people are having good knowledge about causes, symptoms, and mode of transmission of COVID-19 infection. However, there are fewer chances for the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine by people. The public needs to be educated about the working nature of the vaccine. ? 2021, Universitatea de Vest Vasile Goldis din Arad.

In view of this researcher would like to study the knowledge and attitude of general population regarding COVID-19 vaccine so as the vaccination will become acceptable to all population. Methods: The cross-sectional design was used. The study was conducted through online mode during acute phase of disease in January 2021.Data was collected through validated questionnaire. Total 120 individual were included in the study. Results: The result revealed that 2/3 of respondent were having adequate knowledge and having positive about vaccine. Overall acceptance was found 85% among the general population. Respondents that more trust worthy reported information was given by governmental authorities. In initial phase before vaccine entered into the system, people were in confusion state. Through level of knowledge is moderately good, still some classes of people are having lower than reasonable knowledge and attitude towards vaccine. ? 2021, Universitatea de Vest Vasile Goldis din Arad.

"The present article aims to analyze epidemiologic aspects of the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) over different countries across the globe. While analyzing the overall spread of the disease, clusters of countries could be identified where the population-adjusted number of cases and mortality rates (MRs) were significantly different from the others. To draw a comparison over the countries at the same stage of infection, the nature and spread of the infection was evaluated at the 90th day of the pandemic for each country. It was observed that the countries with prevalent malarial transmission tended to have lesser population-adjusted COVID-19 caseloads. It was further observed that high population coverage of the Bacillus Calmette-Gu¨¦rin vaccination was negatively associated with population-adjusted caseloads and MRs due to COVID-19. The present cross-sectional study is an attempt to bring in several social, economic, and structural confounders into understanding of the nature and spread of this novel pandemic globally.","Goswami, Rudra Prosad; Ganguli, Bhaswati; Chatterjee, Moumita",,MEDLINE,COVID-19 Vaccines/immunology; COVID-19/epidemiology; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; SARS-CoV-2; Cross-Sectional Studies; Endemic Diseases; Global Health; Humans; Population Surveillance; Vaccination,20210503.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26875,covidwho-1206827,1096-9071,5,J Med Virol,en,US,2021.0,"J Med Virol;93(5): 3105-3112, 2021 May.

"To verify reliability of antibody detection and investigate population immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the local Chinese population. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Shenzhen to detect anti-coronavirus antibodies including, immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin A (IgA). In the COVID-19 group, nine patients were enrolled after diagnosis. In the control group, 1589 individuals without clinical symptoms (cough, fever, and fatigue) and returning from outside Shenzhen were enrolled. The first study enrollment occurred at the end of February 2020; the final study visit was 18 March 2020. In the COVID-19 group, the seven of nine patients were positive for IgM, IgG, and IgA. Meanwhile, six of the 1589 healthy individuals were found to be weakly positive for IgG. According to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests, the six individuals were all negative. Strong supplemental support for clinical information can be provided by antibody detection, especially for IgA. According to comparison with overseas reports, the infection rate of the Chinese population outside Shenzhen, China, is significantly low, so most of the population in China is still susceptible. Hence, social distancing measures are still inevitable until a vaccine is developed successfully.","Zhang, Cantong; Lin, Liancheng; Tang, Donge; Liu, Fuju; Li, Meng; Li, Qiongying; Deng, Zhaoxiang; Chu, Guohai; Gu, Dayong; Dai, Yong",,MEDLINE,"Antibodies, Viral/blood; COVID-19 Serological Testing; COVID-19/immunology; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; COVID-19/epidemiology; Child; China/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Immunoglobulin A/blood; Immunoglobulin G/blood; Immunoglobulin M/blood; Male; Middle Aged; Reagent Kits, Diagnostic; Reproducibility of Results; Young Adult",20210503.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26355,covidwho-1206805,1096-9071,2,J Med Virol,en,US,2021.0,"J Med Virol;93(2): 1154-1157, 2021 02.

"Introduction: adherence to preventive measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 depends on the people¡äs knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. Living in rural areas may be associated with poor KAP towards COVID-19. This study compares the KAP regarding COVID-19 of people living in rural and urban areas in Cameroon. Methods: this was a comparative cross-sectional study, using data obtained through an online survey of 1,345 Cameroonians amongst which were 828 urban and 517 rural dwellers. The survey questionnaire consisted of; demographic characteristics, 10 questions on Knowledge, 4 on attitudes and 3 on practices. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 25. Results: overall, about two-thirds of participants had correct knowledge of COVID-19. The mean knowledge score for urban dwellers was about twice that of rural dwellers (15.77 ¡À 5.25 vs 8.86 ¡À 7.24 respectively, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, when compared to people who live in urban areas, rural inhabitants are less optimistic about COVID-19 pandemic in Cameroon (OR = 3.43, P&lt;0.001), less likely to accept a trial vaccine for COVID-19 (OR = 1.14, P&lt;0.05), less likely to avoid going to crowded places (OR = 7.42, P&lt;0.01), less likely to wear face mask outdoor (OR = 11.84, P&lt;0,001), and less likely to practice hand hygiene (OR = 1.13, P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: our findings suggest a big gap in COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes, and practices between rural and urban inhabitants in Cameroon. This highlights the need for increase sensitization of Cameroonians, especially rural dwellers on COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes and appropriate practices.","Njingu, Atabong Emmanuel; Jabbossung, Fombo Enjeh; Ndip-Agbor, Tambe Emilia; Dedino, Ankwatia Guisilla",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Rural Population/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Urban Population/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Adult; Cameroon; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult",20210430.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2021.38.234.25964,covidwho-1206457,1937-8688,,Pan Afr Med J,en,UG,2021.0,"Pan Afr Med J;38: 234, 2021.

"Background: Vaccination is an important preventative measure against the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. To implement vaccination and immunization programs effectively, it is essential to investigate public attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines. This study examined the attitudes of Chinese college students toward COVID-19 vaccines and their associated factors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in college students nationwide from December 27, 2020 to January 18, 2021. Attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines and acceptance of future vaccination programs were assessed. Results: Totally, 2,881 college students participated in this survey; of them, 76.3% (95% CI: 74.8% - 77.9%) were willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine in the future. Multiple logistic analysis revealed that students living in urban (OR=1.409, 95% CI: 1.152 - 1.724, p=0.001) and those studying health-related courses (OR=1.581, 95% CI: 1.291 - 1.935, p&lt;0.001) were more likely to have a positive attitude toward COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, those who were worried about being infected with COVID-19 (very much vs no, OR=1.690, 95% CI: 1.212-2.356, p=0.002), heard previously about COVID-19 vaccines (OR=1.659, 95% CI: 1.268-2.170, p&lt;0.001), believed that vaccines are safe (Yes vs No, OR=3.570, 95% CI: 1.825-6.980), thought that vaccines can protect people from being infected with COVID-19 (Yes vs No, OR=1.957, 95% CI: 1.286-2.979, p=0.002), and had encouraged their family and friends to have a vaccine (Yes vs No, OR=17.745, 95% CI: 12.271-25.660, p&lt;0.001) had higher acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusions: A high rate of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines was found among Chinese college students. However, vaccine uptake may be reduced by concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy. Alleviating these concerns and enhancing public confidence in vaccines are crucial for future immunization programs against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bai, Wei; Cai, Hong; Liu, Shou; Liu, Huanzhong; Qi, Han; Chen, Xu; Liu, Rui; Cheung, Teris; Su, Zhaohui; Ng, Chee H; Xiang, Yu-Tao",,MEDLINE,Attitude to Health; COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; Students/psychology; Universities; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Young Adult,20210430.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.58835,covidwho-1206428,1449-2288,6,Int J Biol Sci,en,AU,2021.0,"Int J Biol Sci;17(6): 1469-1475, 2021.

"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence and factors associated with hesitancy in getting the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in Maranh?o, Brazil. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional population-based study conducted from October 19 to 30, 2020. The estimates were calculated based on clustering, stratification, and non-response. A three-stage sampling was adopted, considering stratum, census tracts, and domicile. After systematic analysis, thirty sectors were selected in each stratum, totaling 150 sectors. Each sector contained a fixed number of 34 households, thus totaling 5,100 households. One individual within each household (resident for at least six months and aged one year or more) was selected by a simple random sampling. We questioned participants about their vaccination intention. Univariate association between independent variables and the outcome were verified using descriptive analysis (weighted frequencies) and Pearson&#039;s chi-square test (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Robust multivariate analysis was performed using a three-level hierarchical model. RESULTS: We found 17.5% (95%CI 16.1-19.1%) of the 4,630 individuals interviewed to report hesitancy to be vaccinated against covid-19. After final model adjustment, vaccination hesitancy was statistically higher among residents of the cities of Imperatriz (24.0%;RP = 1.48;IC95% 1.09-2.02) and municipalities of the Grande Ilha de S?o Lu¨ªs (20.7%;RP = 1.34;95%CI 1.02-1.76), female individuals (19.8%;RP = 1.44;95%CI 1.20-1.75), older adults (22.8%;RP = 1.79;IC95% 1.30-2.46), evangelicals (24.1%;RP = 1.49;95%CI 1.24-1.79), and those without reported symptoms (18.6%;RP = 1.24;95%CI 1.02-1.51). We found no statistical differences for other socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, as well as variables related to the labor market, behaviors, and health conditions of the interviewees. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy in Maranh?o and its association with individual, contextual, and clinical factors enable us to identify the groups and contexts of greatest resistance, requiring special attention from public strategies to ensure wide vaccination.","Oliveira, Blca, Campos, M.

"Objective: To assess the acceptance of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine among healthcare workers at two general hospitals in Vietnam when it is available. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a convenience sampling from January to February 2021 among 410 healthcare workers at two general hospitals in Vietnam via a self-administered questionnaire. A multivariable regression analysis was performed to determine predictors of vaccine acceptance including the demographic factors, COVID-19 knowledge, and vaccine beliefs based on the domains of Health Belief Model. Results: Among 410 healthcare workers, 76.10% showed vaccination willingness. Predictors of acceptance were determined that the group reporting as &#039;vaccine acceptance&#039; was more likely to be positive towards the perceived susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 (OR 2.45;95% CI 1.48-4.06, P&amp;lt;0.05), perceived benefits of vaccination, and cues to action (OR 4.36;95% CI 2.35-8.09, and OR 5.49;95% CI 2.84-10.61, respectively, all P&amp;lt;0.001), but less likely to have the perceived barriers to vaccination (OR 0.19;95% CI 0.09-0.38;P&amp;lt;0.001) compared with the no acceptance group. Besides, people who had a good knowledge regarding the severity of illness were 3.37 times more likely to have identified as vaccine acceptance (OR 3.37;95% CI 1.04-10.86, P&amp;lt;0.05). The demographic factors were also associated with willingness to receive the vaccine, with participants who were staff and received COVID-19 information from relatives were less likely to accept the vaccine over those who were doctors and not receiving information from relatives (OR 0.36;95% CI 0.13-0.96, and OR 0.37;95% CI 0.17-0.78, respectively, all P&amp;lt;0.05). Conclusions: A rate of willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 was relatively high with discrepancies between occupation, receiving information from relatives, knowledge toward the severity of illness, and the elements of Health Belief Model. The findings will provide information for the management authorities to develop relevant interventions to promote COVID-19 vaccination uptake. ? 2021 Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine Produced by Wolters KluwerMedknow.

"Objective: To determine the predictors of acceptance and willingness to pay (WTP) for the COVID-19 vaccine among the Indian public and to provide insights for future demand forecasts and pricing considerations. Methods: A nationwide, web-based, self-administered, cross-sectional survey was conducted from 5 to 20 October 2020. The health belief model (HBM) approach was used as a theoretical framework to assess the predictors of acceptance of and WTP for the COVID-19 vaccine. Results: Of 2 480 respondents, 2 451 completed the online survey, yielding a response rate of 98.8%. Participants who participated in the survey had diverse demographics in terms of their location, educational level, occupation type, and family income. Among 2 451 respondents, the majority (89.3%) intended to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Respondents with high perceived benefits of COVID-19 vaccination, such as reduction in worry (OR 5.87;95% CI 4.39-7.96) and sickness (OR 4.31;95% CI 3.31-5.62), showed higher intention to receive the vaccine. However, respondents with a high perception of the side effects and barriers to vaccination (OR 0.36;95% CI 0.25-0.54) and vaccine shortage (OR 0.58;95% CI 0.41-0.81) showed lower intention to receive the vaccine. The majority (2 162, 88.21%) of respondents were willing to pay an amount of INR: 500-1 000 or USD: 6.81-13.62 for a dose of COVID-19 vaccine, with a median (Q1, Q3) of INR: 500 (500, 1 000) or USD: 6.81 (6.81, 13.62). The higher marginal WTP for the COVID-19 vaccine was influenced by advanced age, marital status, female sex, intermediate educational background, high family income, fair or poor perceived health status, and no affordable barriers. Conclusions: The majority of respondents intended to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Healthcare interventions focusing on HBM constructs and demographic predictors associated with low intention to receive the vaccine can be effective in enhancing the coverage of the COVID-19 vaccine. The findings of this study provide guidance for the future price considerations of the COVID-19 vaccine. ? 2021 Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine Produced by Wolters KluwerMedknow.

"Background: The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has recently received emergency approval from the US FDA. The mRNA technology was used to manufacture the Pfizer vaccine;however, as a pioneering technology that has never been used in the manufacture of vaccines, many people have concerns about the vaccine&#039;s side effects. Thus, the current study aimed to track the short-term side effects of the vaccine. Methods: The information in this study was gathered by a Google Form-questionnaire (online survey). The results included the responses of 455 individuals, all of whom are Saudi Arabia inhabitants. Adverse effects of the vaccine were reported after the first and the second doses. Results: The most common symptoms were injection site pain, headaches, flu-like symptoms, fever, and tiredness. Less common side effects were a fast heartbeat, whole body aches, difficulty breathing, joint pain, chills, and drowsiness. Rare side effects include Bell&#039;s palsy and lymph nodes swelling and tenderness. Flu-like symptoms were more common among those under 60 years of age, while injection site pain was more frequent among recipients who were 60 years and older. The study revealed a significant increase in the number of females who suffered from the vaccine side effects compared to males. Difficulty of breathing was more reported among recipients who had been previously infected with the coronavirus compared to those who had not been previously infected. Conclusion: Most of the side effects reported in this study were consistent with Pfizer&#039;s fact sheet for recipients and caregivers. Further studies are required to determine the long-term side effects.","El-Shitany, N. A.; Harakeh, S.; Badr-Eldin, S. M.; Bagher, A. M.; Eid, B.; Almukadi, H.; Alghamdi, B. S.; Alahmadi, A.

"This study aims to identify the characteristics of COVID-19 cases associated with infection including socio-demographic background and the source of infection. We performed a descriptive cross-sectional study design including a total of 5959 suspected COVID-19 cases. People attending primary health care centers and general hospitals in Baghdad/Al-Rusafa DOH were included. An active survey for the tracing of the contacts of positive cases tracing was done from the beginning of the outbreak, and active surveillance and rapid tests were performed from 18/4/2020. Data was obtained from the surveillance unit at Baghdad/ Al-Rusafa DOH during the study period. Up to 29/5/2020, we identified 5959 suspected cases were 5959, 333 probable cases, and 1658 confirmed cases. Of the confirmed cases, 577 cases recovered and 64 died. Regarding age group, 40% of cases were between 41 and-60 years old. Males represented 57% of cases.

"OBJECTIVES: To explore attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination among perinatal women. METHODS: A nationwide online, cross-sectional survey was conducted in Qatar from 15th October 2020 to 15th November 2020 with voluntary participation open to all adult residents. Of the respondents, the population group for this study comprised the 341 pregnant and breastfeeding participants. The survey utilized a composite questionnaire incorporating a validated instrument to measure vaccine attitudes. The responses were recorded and analysed with statistical analysis being performed with SPSS software. Outcome measures included intentions towards vaccination and potential factors influencing vaccine hesitancy (contextual factors, vaccine specific concerns and group/individual influences). RESULTS: Perinatal women exhibited a vaccine hesitancy rate of 25% towards COVID-19 immunisation. The main concerns of the group were of infection risks and main factor determining vaccine hesitancy was of vaccine specific safety concerns. Previous vaccine &quot;acceptors&quot; showed vaccine hesitancy to COVID-19 immunisation. A third of the group cited non availability of the vaccine as a concern. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine trials amongst pregnant and lactating women have lagged behind those for general populations and this has compounded concerns around safety in this special group. Perinatal women constitute a vulnerable group and play an important role in vaccination of wider family members. This study highlights the need for trials and data for COVID-19 vaccine in this group to be able to achieve appreciable numbers needed for herd immunity and ultimately control of the pandemic.","Mohan, Suruchi; Reagu, Shuja; Lindow, Stephen; Alabdulla, Majid",,MEDLINE,,20210429.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2021-0069,covidwho-1204143,1619-3997,,J. perinat. med,en,DE,2021.0,J Perinat Med;2021 Apr 27. ,COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in perinatal women: a cross sectional survey.,article,,,
"BACKGROUND: Although the approved COVID-19 vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective, mass vaccination in Bangladeshi people remains a challenge. As a vaccination effort, the study provided an empirical evidence on willingness to vaccinate by sociodemographic, clinical and regional differences in Bangladeshi adults. METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis from a household survey of 3646 adults aged 18 years or older was conducted in 8 districts of Bangladesh, from December 12, 2020, to January 7, 2021. Multinomial regression examined the impact of socio-demographic, clinical and healthcare-releated factors on hesitancy and reluctance of vaccination for COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 3646 respondents (2212 men [60.7%]; mean [sd] age, 37.4 [13.9] years), 74.6% reported their willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 when a safe and effective vaccine is available without a fee, while 8.5% were reluctant to vaccinate. With a minimum fee, 46.5% of the respondents showed intent to vaccinate. Among the respondents, 16.8% reported adequate adherence to health safety regulations, and 35.5% reported high confidence in the country&#039;s healthcare system. The COVID-19 vaccine refusal was significantly high in elderly, rural, semi-urban, and slum communities, farmers, day-laborers, homemakers, low-educated group, and those who had low confidence in the country&#039;s healthcare system. Also, the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was high in the elderly population, low-educated group, day-laborers, people with chronic diseases, and people with low confidence in the country&#039;s healthcare system. CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of vaccine refusal and hesitancy was observed in rural people and slum dwellers in Bangladesh. The rural community and slum dwellers had a low literacy level, low adherence to health safety regulations and low confidence in healthcare system. The ongoing app-based registration for vaccination increased hesitancy and reluctancy in low-educated group. For rural, semi-urban, and slum people, outreach centers for vaccination can be established to ensure the vaccine&#039;s nearby availability and limit associated travel costs. In rural areas, community health workers, valued community-leaders, and non-governmental organizations can be utilized to motivate and educate people for vaccination against COVID-19. Further, emphasis should be given to the elderly and diseased people with tailored health messages and assurance from healthcare professionals. The media may play a responsible role with the vaccine education program and eliminate the social stigma about the vaccination. Finally, vaccination should be continued without a fee and thus Bangladesh&#039;s COVID vaccination program can become a model for other low and middle-income countries.","Abedin, Minhazul; Islam, Mohammad Aminul; Rahman, Farah Naz; Reza, Hasan Mahmud; Hossain, Mohammad Zakir; Hossain, Mohammad Anwar; Arefin, Adittya; Hossain, Ahmed",,MEDLINE,COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Vaccination/psychology; Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19/pathology; COVID-19/virology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; SARS-CoV-2/isolation &amp;amp; purification; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination/economics; Vaccination/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Vaccination Refusal/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Young Adult,20210429.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250495,covidwho-1204132,1932-6203,4,PLoS One,en,US,2021.0,"PLoS One;16(4): e0250495, 2021.

"Vaccines are critical for curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic and may represent an important tool for return to &quot;normalcy&quot; on college campuses in the Fall of 2021. The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent of vaccination coverage and intention to vaccinate among college students. College students (N = 457) enrolled in the Spring 2021 semester at a university in New Jersey completed a cross-sectional survey. The survey collected information on demographics, COVID-19 and vaccination history, knowledge levels and sources of COVID-19 vaccine information, and vaccine attitudes. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with vaccination, and the intention to vaccinate among non-vaccinated students. Results indicate that 23% (n = 105) of participants reported being vaccinated already. Among non-vaccinated students, 52.8% indicated their intention to receive the vaccine when it is made available to college students.

Among non-vaccinated students, those who discussed COVID-19 vaccine information with others (aOR = 5.38, p &lt; 0.001), and exhibited more overall positive attitudes regarding vaccination (aOR = 2.69, p &lt; 0.001), were more likely to indicate their willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Findings of this study highlight the need for additional education and vaccine outreach aimed at promoting uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine among college students.","Kecojevic, Aleksandar; Basch, Corey H; Sullivan, Marianne; Chen, Yen-Tyng; Davi, Nicole K",,MEDLINE,,20210429.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10900-021-00992-3,covidwho-1202799,1573-3610,,J. community health,en,NL,2021.0,J Community Health;2021 Apr 27. ,COVID-19 Vaccination and Intention to Vaccinate Among a Sample of College Students in New Jersey.,article,,,
"The cross-sectional observational study evaluated the prevalence and predictors of needle-fear among school-going children during mass Measles-Rubella (MR) immunization campaign (year 2017) in the north Indian city of Chandigarh. Fear of needle was assessed using a single-item self-report global question, anxiety was assessed using the Likert scale (score 1-5) and the standardized &quot;Children Faces Scale&quot; where facial responses were graded from 0 to 4. Out of a total sample of 2568 school children, 1225 (47.7%) reported needle fear (95% CI: 45.8%-49.6%) on a global single item assessment. On an anxiety related Likert scale, 52.3% did not respond (mainly younger children) and among those who responded, 42.6% (523/1226) showed significant anxiety (score of &amp;#8805;3 on Likert scale of 1 to 5). Finally, 17.4% children (95% CI: 15.9%-18.9%) (n = 446/2568) scored 2 or above (indicating significant needle fear) on the &#039;Children Faces Scale&#039; during the actual vaccination procedure. The needle fear were significantly increased among girl students as compared to boys (adjusted OR 2.58; 95% CI: 2.05-3.24, p?&lt; 0.001) as well as children accompanied by their parents (adjusted OR 2.05; 95% CI:1.57-2.69, p &lt; 0.001). On the other hand, needle fear was significantly lowered in children studying in private schools as compared to public school children (adjusted OR 0.45; 95% CI: 0.28-0.74, p?= 0.002). The needle fear, which was an overriding concern in the minds of girls, children accompanied by their parents, and public-school students, must be proactively addressed for successful mass vaccination campaigns.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the influx of immunoassays for the detection of antibodies towards severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into the global market. The Canadian Public Health Laboratory Network Serology Task Force undertook a nationwide evaluation of twelve laboratory and six point-of-care based commercial serological assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We determined that there was considerable variability in the performance of individual tests and that an orthogonal testing algorithm should be prioritized to maximize the accuracy and comparability of results across the country. The manual enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and point-of-care tests evaluated had lower specificity and increased coefficients of variation compared to automated EIA platforms putting into question their utility for large-scale sero-surveillance. Overall, the data presented here provide a comprehensive approach for applying accurate serological assays for longitudinal sero-surveillance and vaccine trials while informing Canadian public health policy.","Stein, Derek R.; Osiowy, Carla, Gretchen, Ainsley, Thorlacius, Laurel, Fudge, Denise, Lang, Amanda, Sekirov, Inna, Morshed, Muhammad, Levett, Paul N.; Tran, Vanessa, Kus, Julianne, Gubbay, Jonathan, Mohan, Vandana, Charlton, Carmen, Kanji, Jamil N.; Tipples, Graham, Serhir, Bouchra, Therrien, Christian, Roger, Michel, Jiao, Lei, Zahariadis, George, Needle, Robert, Gilbert, Laura, Desnoyers, Guillaume, Garceau, Richard, Bouhtiauy, Ihssan, Longtin, Jean, Dibernardo, Antonia, Lindsay, L.

"This article reports the intent to receive a SARS-COV-2 vaccine, its predictors and willingness to pay in Bangladesh. We carried out an online cross-sectional survey of 697 adults from the general population of Bangladesh in January 2021. A structured questionnaire was used to assess vaccination intent. The questionnaire included sociodemographic variables and health belief model constructs which may predict vaccination intent. Among the participants, 26% demonstrated a definite intent, 43% probable intent, 24% probable negative, and 7% a definite negative intention. Multivariable logistic regression analyses suggest an association between definite intent and previous COVID-19 infection (OR: 2.86;95% CI: 1.71¨C4.78), perceiving COVID-19 as serious (OR: 1.93;1.04¨C3.59), the belief that vaccination would make them feel less worried about catching COVID-19 (OR: 4.42;2.25¨C8.68), and concerns about vaccine affordability (OR: 1.51;1.01¨C2.25). Individuals afraid of the side effects (OR: 0.34;0.21¨C0.53) and those who would take the vaccine if the vaccine were taken by many others (OR: 0.44;0.29¨C0.67) are less likely to have a definite intent. A definite negative intent is associated with the concern that the vaccine may not be halal (OR: 2.03;1.04¨C3.96). Furthermore, 68.4% are willing to pay for the vaccine. The median amount that they are willing to pay is USD 7.08. The study findings reveal that the definite intent to receive the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among the general population varies depending on their COVID-19-related health beliefs and no significant association was found with sociodemographic variables.","Kabir, Russell, Mahmud, Ilias, Chowdhury, Mohammad Tawfique Hossain, Vinnakota, Divya, Jahan, Shah Saif, Siddika, Nazeeba, Isha, Samia Naz, Nath, Sujan Kanti, Hoque Apu, Ehsanul",,MDPI,,20210428.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9050416,covidwho-1201328,,5,Vaccines,en,,2021.0,"Vaccines; 9(5):416, 2021.",COVID-19 Vaccination Intent and Willingness to Pay in Bangladesh: A Cross-Sectional Study,article,,,9
"The explanation of the potential interaction between the influenza vaccine and SARS-CoV-2 infection is urgently needed in the public health.

"Vaccines are effective interventions that can reduce the high burden of diseases globally. However, public vaccine hesitancy is a pressing problem for public health authorities. With the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, little information is available on the public acceptability and attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccines in Jordan. This study aimed to investigate the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines and its predictors in addition to the attitudes towards these vaccines among public in Jordan. An online, cross-sectional, and self-administered questionnaire was instrumentalized to survey adult participants from Jordan on the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines. Logistic regression analysis was used to find the predictors of COVID-19 vaccines&#039; acceptability. A total of 3,100 participants completed the survey. The public acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines was fairly low (37.4%) in Jordan. Males (OR = 2.488, 95CI% = 1.834-3.375, p &lt; .001) and those who took the seasonal influenza vaccine (OR = 2.036, 95CI% = 1.306-3.174, p = .002) were more likely to accept COVID-19 vaccines. Similarly, participants who believed that vaccines are generally safe (OR = 9.258, 95CI% = 6.020-14.237, p &lt; .001) and those who were willing to pay for vaccines (OR = 19.223, 95CI% = 13.665-27.042, p &lt; .001), once available, were more likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccines. However, those above 35 years old (OR = 0.376, 95CI% = 0.233-0.607, p &lt; .001) and employed participants (OR = 0.542, 95CI% = 0.405-0.725, p &lt; .001) were less likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, participants who believed that there was a conspiracy behind COVID-19 (OR = 0.502, 95CI% = 0.356-0.709, p &lt; .001) and those who do not trust any source of information on COVID-19 vaccines (OR = 0.271, 95CI% = 0.183-0.400, p &lt; .001), were less likely to have acceptance towards them. The most trusted sources of information on COVID-19 vaccines were healthcare providers. Systematic interventions are required by public health authorities to reduce the levels of vaccines&#039; hesitancy and improve their acceptance. We believe these results and specifically the low rate of acceptability is alarming to Jordanian health authorities and should stir further studies on the root causes and the need of awareness campaigns. These interventions should take the form of reviving the trust in national health authorities and structured awareness campaigns that offer transparent information about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines and the technology that was utilized in their production.","El-Elimat, Tamam; AbuAlSamen, Mahmoud M; Almomani, Basima A; Al-Sawalha, Nour A; Alali, Feras Q",,MEDLINE,"Attitude; COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Vaccination/psychology; Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19/virology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Jordan; Male; Odds Ratio; SARS-CoV-2/isolation &amp;amp; purification; Statistics, Nonparametric; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Vaccination Refusal/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Young Adult",20210427.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250555,covidwho-1199978,1932-6203,4,PLoS One,en,US,2021.0,"PLoS One;16(4): e0250555, 2021.

"Introduction: Around 30% of patients with severe COVID-19 infection are need admission to an ICU for specialized care. Ninety percent of these patients present with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome corona. Inadequate knowledge and incorrect attitudes among the postgraduates working in ICU can directly influence practices and lead to poor infection control practice, poor management, and spread of disease. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, perception, and attitude of postgraduate students posted toward the COVID-19. Materials and methods: After ethical committee approval (CTRI REF/2020/11/038549), a descriptive cross-sectional study was done among postgraduate students of different teaching hospitals in South India. Data were collected through the first week off from September 1 to September 8, 2020, during the peak of the pandemic. A convenience sampling technique was used to select participants. The sample size was calculated using EpiCalc-2000 based on the following assumption: the proportion of good knowledge 50%, level of confidence 95% and precision 5%, and apparent prevalence 0.05, to be 74. Then, the sample size increased by 10% to overcome non-response. Confidentiality precautions were ensured during the data collection process. A self-administered questionnaire was used, it was developed by the authors after reviewing previously conducted research, visiting the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and WHO websites for frequently asked questions. The questionnaire for best practices was selected after studying various review articles, meta-analyzes, and the WHO website. The questionnaire was checked and validated for content and relevance by authors, and one public health and one anesthesia professor. The questionnaire covered the following: (I) Demographic characters: age, sex, years of critical care experience, type of organization in which responders are working, hours of work/day, and whether they were quarantined after the work. (II) The knowledge section: consisted of 20 knowledge questions covering the main general information, mode of transmission, treatment modalities, and ways of disease prevention. Each question was answered by either yes, no, or don&#039;t know. (III) The attitude section;included 10 questions assessing the responder&#039;s attitudes of COVID-19 as a preventable and controllable disease (six items), their attitudes toward regulations taken by the Hospital/Government to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic situation (four items). Response to each item was recorded on the 5-point Likert scale as follows: strongly agree (5-points), agree (4-points), undecided (3-points), disagree (2-points), and strongly disagree. (IV) Risk perception: included assessment of postgraduates&#039; feelings and perception of fear from catching COVID-19. The response could be either yes or no. As the responders were from various hospitals in south India, we used the online data collection method via Google Forms. Results: Best practices 20 questions 95.3% of responders commented that there are separate donning and doffing rooms. 40% of hospitals had 2:1 and another 40% 3:1 of patient to staff ratio. It is 43.4% of responders were unaware of how many times per day the floors and surfaces are cleaned. Only 47% of responders committed that the WHO&#039;S five moments of hand hygiene was strictly followed. 17% of places did not use bacterial filters for mechanically ventilated patients and 53% used HME. 71% of responders were aware of the modified ACLS guidelines for COVID suspect patients. 55% of responders agreed that Remedisivir should be started only in moderate to severe cases. 55% of responders preferred Methylprednisolone to treat COVID sequelae. Knowledge: 10 questions The mean knowledge score of participants was 8.5 ¡À 2.7 ranged from 7 to 10, with the mean correct answer rate of questions was 88.4%. Attitude 10 questions although the majority of our participants considered COVID-19 as a severe disease, they agreed that this disease can be prevented. The vast majority of doctors agreed that infection cont ol standard precaution can protect against COVID-19 (95.6%) after working in COVID ICU. Generally speaking, a positive attitude was more observed among males than females in many attitude items. Perception: 10 questions regarding risk perception, about 83.1% of our participants reported that they were afraid of being infected with COVID-19, and 89.2% stated that they were more susceptible to COVID-19 infection as compared to others. The most common statements accepted by participants as causes of perception of fear of COVID-19 infection were the following: fear of transmission of infection to their families (96.5%), the disease is highly transmissible (91.74%), COVID-I9 new disease with no available vaccine (58.6%) or treatment (77%), the fatality of the disease (62.1%). Discussions: In the current study, the knowledge level of postgraduates about COVID-19 was high. The mean correct answer rate was 8.5 ¡À 2.7. This comes in accordance with studies conducted by Abdul, Zhang, and Ghiao, who had reported about 80 to 90% of their respondents had a sufficient level of knowledge. Although many articles were charting out the best practices, we could not find any systematic survey to check whether the practices were followed. WHO&#039;s 5 moments of hand hygiene, refrain from touching eyes, mouth, and nose, and putting surgical face mask were among the preventive measures frequently accepted by our participants. Ng et al. outlined that surgical masks are similarly as effective as N95 respirators if used with hand wash and other infection prevention precautions. Inconsistent with our findings, Kumar et al. and Olum et al. found HCWs&#039; knowledge regarding the role of face masks in the prevention of the disease to be moderate to poor. It worth mentioning that, and despite their high knowledge score, the vast majority of our respondents were afraid and felt more susceptible to have COVID-19 infection. This parallels studies that found an association between the level of fear and risk perception. Abdel in his Egyptian study reported that two-thirds of HCWs thought they were more susceptible to get infected, which resembles our study. Conclusion: At the time of writing this manuscript, the national statistics indicate that up to 30% of SARS COVID-19 patients needed ICU admission for ARDS. The majority of them needed different levels of oxygen support from simple masks to NIV to ventilator support. Probably, the timely availability of PPE, the strict infection control measures, and the frequent CME&#039;s and awareness sessions are responsible for making India one among the handful of countries with a very low mortality rate of 10%.","Yuvashree, M.; Gayathri, B.; Pushparani, Ksheerabdhi, S.",,EMBASE,,20210427.0,https://doi.org/10.5005/jp-journals-10071-23711.92,covidwho-1200258,,SUPPL 1,Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine,en,,2021.0,"Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine; 25(SUPPL 1):S50-S51, 2021.","Assessment of best practices, knowledge, attitude, and perception of postgraduates working in COVID ICU-a multicenter study from South India",article,,,25
"BACKGROUND: A central component of the public health strategy to control the COVID-19 pandemic involves encouraging mask wearing and social distancing to protect individuals from acquiring and transmitting the virus. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the psychological factors that drive adoption or rejection of these protective behaviors, which can inform public health interventions to control the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of a representative sample of 1074 US adults and assessed three novel potential predictors of COVID-19 behaviors: trait reactance, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, and COVID-19 apocalypse beliefs. Key outcomes (dependent variables) included an index of COVID-19 protective behaviors, the number of trips taken from the home, and COVID-19 knowledge. RESULTS: In bivariate analyses, all three predictors were significantly correlated in the hypothesized direction with the three COVID-19 outcomes. Specifically, each predictor was negatively (P&lt;.01) correlated with the COVID-19 protective behaviors index and COVID-19 knowledge score, and positively correlated with trips taken from home per week (more of which was considered higher risk). COVID-19 protective behaviors and COVID-19 knowledge were significantly lower in the top median compared to the bottom median for all three predictors. In general, these findings remained significant after adjusting for all novel predictors plus age, gender, income, education, race, political party, and religiosity. Self-identified Republicans (vs other political affiliations) reported the highest values for each of the novel predictors. CONCLUSIONS: This study can inform the development of health communication interventions to encourage the adoption of COVID-19 protective behaviors. Interestingly, we found that higher scores of all three novel predictors were associated with lower COVID-19 knowledge, suggesting that lack of an accurate understanding of the virus may be driving some of these attitudes; although, it is also possible that these attributes may interfere with one&#039;s willingness or ability to seek and absorb accurate health information. These individuals may be particularly immune to accepting new information and yielding their beliefs. Health communication professionals may apply lessons learned from countering similar beliefs around climate change and vaccine hesitancy. Messages designed for individuals prone to reactance may be more effective if they minimize controlling language and emphasize the individual&#039;s independence in adopting these behavioral recommendations. Messaging for those who possess conspiracy beliefs should similarly not assume that providing evidence contrary to these beliefs will alone alter behavior. Other communication techniques such as rolling with resistance, a strategy used in motivational interviewing, may be helpful. Messaging for those with apocalyptic beliefs may require using religious leaders as the message source and using scripture that would support the adoption of COVID-19 protection behaviors.","Resnicow, Ken; Bacon, Elizabeth; Yang, Penny; Hawley, Sarah; Van Horn, M Lee; An, Lawrence",,MEDLINE,COVID-19/psychology; Health Behavior; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; COVID-19/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2/isolation &amp;amp; purification; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States/epidemiology; Young Adult,20210426.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/23488,covidwho-1197467,1438-8871,4,J Med Internet Res,en,CA,2021.0,"J Med Internet Res;23(4): e23488, 2021 04 20.

"PURPOSE: As frontline workers facing the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers should be well-prepared to fight the disease and prevent harm to their patients and themselves. Our study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practice of oncologists in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on them. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a validated questionnaire disseminated to oncologists by SurveyMonkey. The tool had 42 questions that captured participants&#039; knowledge, attitude, and practice; their experiences; and the pandemic&#039;s impact on various aspects of their lives. Participants from Middle East and North African countries, Brazil, and the Philippines completed the electronic survey between April 24 and May 15, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 1,010 physicians who participated in the study, 54.75% were male and 64.95% were medical or clinical oncologists. The level of knowledge regarding the prevention and transmission of the virus was good in 52% of participants. The majority (92%) were worried about contracting the virus either extremely (30%) or mildly (62%), and 84.85% were worried about transmitting the virus to their families. Approximately 76.93% reported they would take the COVID 19 vaccine once available, with oncologists practicing in Brazil having the highest odds ratio of intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (odds ratio, 11.8, 95% CI, 5.96 to 23.38, P &lt; .001). Participants reported a negative impact of the pandemic on relations with coworkers (15.84%), relations with family (27.84%), their emotional and mental well-being (48.51%), research productivity (34.26%), and financial income (52.28%). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has adverse effects on various personal and professional aspects of oncologists&#039; lives. Interventions should be implemented to mitigate the negative impact and prepare oncologists to manage future crises with more efficiency and resilience.","Jazieh, Abdul Rahman; Coutinho, Anelisa K; Bensalem, Assia A; Alsharm, Abdullah A; Errihani, Hassan; Mula-Hussain, Layth; Al-Sukhun, Sana; Sampaio-Filho, Carlos A; Khorshid, Ola M R; De Guzman, Roselle B; Alkaiyat, Mohammad O; Jradi, Hoda A",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Oncologists/psychology; SARS-CoV-2/isolation &amp;amp; purification; Surveys and Questionnaires; Africa, Northern; Brazil; COVID-19/epidemiology; COVID-19/virology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Middle East; Oncologists/economics; Oncologists/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Pandemics; Philippines; Practice Patterns, Physicians&amp;apos;; SARS-CoV-2/physiology",20210426.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1200/GO.20.00542,covidwho-1197355,2687-8941,,JCO Glob Oncol,en,US,2021.0,"JCO Glob Oncol;7: 242-252, 2021 02.

"BACKGROUND: Public support of public health measures including physical distancing, masking, staying home while sick, avoiding crowded indoor spaces and contact tracing/exposure notification applications remains critical for reducing spread of COVID-19. The aim of our work was to understand current behaviours and attitudes towards public health measures as well as barriers individuals face in following public health measures. We also sought to identify attitudes persons have regarding a COVID-19 vaccine and reasons why they may not accept a vaccine. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in August 2020, in Alberta, Canada in persons 18 years and older. This survey evaluated current behaviours, barriers and attitudes towards public health measures and a COVID-19 vaccine. Cluster analysis was used to identify key patterns that summarize data variations among observations. RESULTS: Of the 60 total respondents, the majority of persons were always or often physically distancing (73%), masking (65%) and staying home while sick (67%). Bars/pubs/lounges or nightclubs were visited rarely or never by 63% of respondents. Persons identified staying home while sick to provide the highest benefit (83%) in reducing spread of COVID-19. There were a large proportion of persons who had not downloaded or used a contact tracing/exposure notification app (77%) and who would not receive a COVID-19 vaccine when available (20%) or were unsure (12%). Reporting health authorities as most trusted sources of health information was associated with greater percentage of potential uptake of vaccine but not related to contact tracing app download and use. Individuals with lower concern of getting and spreading COVID-19 showed the least uptake of public health measures except for avoiding public places such as bars. Lower concern regarding COVID-19 was also associated with more negative responses to taking a potential COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSION: These results suggest informational frames and themes focusing on individual risks, highlighting concern for COVID-19 and targeting improving trust for health authorities may be most effective in increasing public health measures. With the ultimate goal of preventing spread of COVID-19, understanding persons&#039; attitudes towards both public health measures and a COVID-19 vaccine remains critical to addressing barriers and implementing targeted interventions and messaging to improve uptake.","Lang, Raynell; Benham, Jamie L; Atabati, Omid; Hollis, Aidan; Tombe, Trevor; Shaffer, Blake; Burns, Katharina Kovacs; MacKean, Gail; L¨¦veill¨¦, Tova; McCormack, Brandi; Sheikh, Hasan; Fullerton, Madison M; Tang, Theresa; Boucher, Jean-Christophe; Constantinescu, Cora; Mourali, Mehdi; Manns, Braden J; Marshall, Deborah A; Hu, Jia; Oxoby, Robert J",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Communicable Disease Control; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Adolescent; Adult; Alberta; COVID-19 Vaccines; Communication; Contact Tracing; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination/psychology; Young Adult",20210426.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10790-0,covidwho-1197345,1471-2458,1,BMC Public Health,en,GB,2021.0,"BMC Public Health;21(1): 765, 2021 04 21.

"BACKGROUND: Many pregnant persons in the United States are receiving messenger RNA (mRNA) coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccines, but data are limited on their safety in pregnancy. METHODS: From December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021, we used data from the &quot;v-safe after vaccination health checker&quot; surveillance system, the v-safe pregnancy registry, and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to characterize the initial safety of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines in pregnant persons. RESULTS: A total of 35,691 v-safe participants 16 to 54 years of age identified as pregnant. Injection-site pain was reported more frequently among pregnant persons than among nonpregnant women, whereas headache, myalgia, chills, and fever were reported less frequently. Among 3958 participants enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry, 827 had a completed pregnancy, of which 115 (13.9%) resulted in a pregnancy loss and 712 (86.1%) resulted in a live birth (mostly among participants with vaccination in the third trimester). Adverse neonatal outcomes included preterm birth (in 9.4%) and small size for gestational age (in 3.2%); no neonatal deaths were reported. Although not directly comparable, calculated proportions of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in persons vaccinated against Covid-19 who had a completed pregnancy were similar to incidences reported in studies involving pregnant women that were conducted before the Covid-19 pandemic. Among 221 pregnancy-related adverse events reported to the VAERS, the most frequently reported event was spontaneous abortion (46 cases). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings did not show obvious safety signals among pregnant persons who received mRNA Covid-19 vaccines. However, more longitudinal follow-up, including follow-up of large numbers of women vaccinated earlier in pregnancy, is necessary to inform maternal, pregnancy, and infant outcomes.","Shimabukuro, Tom T; Kim, Shin Y; Myers, Tanya R; Moro, Pedro L; Oduyebo, Titilope; Panagiotakopoulos, Lakshmi; Marquez, Paige L; Olson, Christine K; Liu, Ruiling; Chang, Karen T; Ellington, Sascha R; Burkel, Veronica K; Smoots, Ashley N; Green, Caitlin J; Licata, Charles; Zhang, Bicheng C; Alimchandani, Meghna; Mba-Jonas, Adamma; Martin, Stacey W; Gee, Julianne M; Meaney-Delman, Dana M",,MEDLINE,,20210426.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983,covidwho-1196904,1533-4406,24,N Engl J Med,en,US,2021.0,"N Engl J Med;384(24): 2273-2282, 2021 06 17.

"BACKGROUND: Global efforts toward the development and deployment of a vaccine for COVID-19 are rapidly advancing. To achieve herd immunity, widespread administration of vaccines is required, which necessitates significant cooperation from the general public. As such, it is crucial that governments and public health agencies understand public sentiments toward vaccines, which can help guide educational campaigns and other targeted policy interventions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and apply an artificial intelligence-based approach to analyze public sentiments on social media in the United Kingdom and the United States toward COVID-19 vaccines to better understand the public attitude and concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: Over 300,000 social media posts related to COVID-19 vaccines were extracted, including 23,571 Facebook posts from the United Kingdom and 144,864 from the United States, along with 40,268 tweets from the United Kingdom and 98,385 from the United States from March 1 to November 22, 2020. We used natural language processing and deep learning-based techniques to predict average sentiments, sentiment trends, and topics of discussion. These factors were analyzed longitudinally and geospatially, and manual reading of randomly selected posts on points of interest helped identify underlying themes and validated insights from the analysis. RESULTS: Overall averaged positive, negative, and neutral sentiments were at 58%, 22%, and 17% in the United Kingdom, compared to 56%, 24%, and 18% in the United States, respectively. Public optimism over vaccine development, effectiveness, and trials as well as concerns over their safety, economic viability, and corporation control were identified. We compared our findings to those of nationwide surveys in both countries and found them to correlate broadly. CONCLUSIONS: Artificial intelligence-enabled social media analysis should be considered for adoption by institutions and governments alongside surveys and other conventional methods of assessing public attitude. Such analyses could enable real-time assessment, at scale, of public confidence and trust in COVID-19 vaccines, help address the concerns of vaccine sceptics, and help develop more effective policies and communication strategies to maximize uptake.","Hussain, Amir; Tahir, Ahsen; Hussain, Zain; Sheikh, Zakariya; Gogate, Mandar; Dashtipour, Kia; Ali, Azhar; Sheikh, Aziz",,MEDLINE,Artificial Intelligence; COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; Public Opinion; Social Media/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Vaccination/psychology; COVID-19/epidemiology; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; COVID-19/psychology; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; SARS-CoV-2/isolation &amp;amp; purification; United Kingdom/epidemiology; United States/epidemiology,20210423.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/26627,covidwho-1195982,1438-8871,4,J Med Internet Res,en,CA,2021.0,"J Med Internet Res;23(4): e26627, 2021 04 05.

"BACKGROUND: Developing a safe and effective vaccine will be the principal way of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. However, current COVID-19 vaccination trials are not adequately representing a diverse participant population in terms of age, ethnicity and comorbidities. Achieving the representative recruitment targets that are adequately powered to the study remains one of the greatest challenges in clinical trial management. To ensure accuracy and generalisability of the safety and efficacy conclusions generated by clinical trials, it is crucial to recruit patient cohorts as representative as possible of the future target population. Missing these targets can lead to reduced validity of the study results and can often slow down drug development leading to costly delays. OBJECTIVE: This study explores the key factors related to perceptions and participation in vaccination trials. METHODS: This study involved an anonymous cross-sectional online survey circulated across the UK. Statistical analysis was done in six phases. Multi-nominal logistic models examined demographic and geographic factors that may impact vaccine uptake. RESULTS: The survey had 4884 participants of which 9.44% were Black Asian Minority Ethnic (BAME). Overall, 2020 (41.4%) respondents were interested in participating in vaccine trials; 27.6% of the respondents were not interested and 31.1% were unsure. The most interested groups were male (OR = 1.29), graduates (OR = 1.28), the 40-49 and 50-59 age groups (OR = 1.88 and OR = 1.46 respectively) and those with no health issues (OR = 1.06). The least interested groups were BAME (OR = 0.43), those from villages and small towns (OR = 0.66 and 0.54 respectively) and those aged 70 and above (OR = 1.11). CONCLUSIONS: In order to have a vaccination that is generalisable to the entire population, greater work needs to be done in engaging a diverse cohort of participants. Public health campaigns need to be targeted in improving trial recruitment rates for the elderly, BAME community and the less educated rural population.","Sethi, Sonika; Kumar, Aditi; Mandal, Anandadeep; Shaikh, Mohammed; Hall, Claire A; Kirk, Jeremy M W; Moss, Paul; Brookes, Matthew J; Basu, Supratik",,MEDLINE,COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Clinical Trials as Topic; Patient Selection; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom; Vaccination; Young Adult,20210423.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-021-05250-4,covidwho-1195925,1745-6215,1,Trials,en,GB,2021.0,"Trials;22(1): 296, 2021 Apr 20.

"Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at an increased risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and warrant COVID-19 vaccination to reduce nosocomial infections. This study investigated: (1) the prevalence of behavioral intention of COVID-19 vaccination (BICV) under eight scenarios combining vaccines&#039; effectiveness/safety/cost, plus two general scenarios of free/self-paid vaccination given governmental/hospital recommendations, (2) perceptions involving preferred timing of COVID-19 vaccination and impacts of various attributes on BICV, and (3) factors of BICV based on the Health Belief Model. An anonymous online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 2,254 full-time doctors/nurses in three Chinese provinces during 10/2020-11/2020. The prevalence of BICV was 75.1%/68.0% among nurses/doctors under the most optimum scenario of this study (free/80% effectiveness/rare mild side effects); it dropped to 64.6%/56.5% if it costed 600 Yuan (USD90). Similar prevalence was obtained (72.7%/71.2%) if the vaccination was recommended by the government/hospitals but dropped to &lt;50% if effectiveness was 50% or mild side effects were common; 13.0% preferred to take up COVID-19 vaccination at the soonest (81.8% would wait and see). Scientific proof (completion of phase III clinical trials and approval from health authorities) was rated the highest in its impacts on vaccination decision, followed by vaccines&#039; performance, and then logistics. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that perceived severity, perceived barriers, cues to action, and self-efficacy (but neither perceived susceptibility nor perceived barriers) were significantly associated with the two BICV outcomes.

"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There seems to be hesitation in the general population in accepting COVID 19 vaccine because of associated myths and/or misinformation. This study is dedicated to develop and validate a tool to interpret vaccine acceptance and/or hesitancy by assessing the knowledge, attitude, practices, and concerns regarding the COVID vaccine. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Mixed methods study design was used. In phase 1, the questionnaire was developed through literature review, focus group discussion, expert evaluation, and pre-testing. In phase 2, the validity of the questionnaire was obtained by conducting a cross-sectional survey on 201 participants. The construct validity was established via principal component analysis. Cronbach&#039;s alpha value was used to assess the reliability of the questionnaire. RESULTS: The 39-item questionnaire to assess the knowledge, attitude, practices, and concerns regarding the COVID-19 vaccine was developed. The Cronbach&#039;s alpha value of the questionnaire was 0.86 suggesting a good internal consistency.

"There is a critical need for the public to have trusted sources of vaccine information. A longitudinal online study assessed trust in COVID-19 vaccine information from 10 sources. A factor analysis for data reduction revealed two factors. The first factor contained politically conservative sources (PCS) of information. The second factor included eight news sources representing mainstream sources (MS). Multivariable logistic regression models were used. Trust in Dr. Fauci was also examined. High trust in MS was associated with intention to encourage family members to get COVID-19 vaccines, altruistic beliefs that more vulnerable people should have vaccine priority, and belief that racial minorities with higher rates of COVID-19 deaths should have priority. High trust in PCS was associated with intention to discourage friends from getting vaccinated. Higher trust in PCS was also associated with participants more likely to disagree that minorities with higher rates of COVID-19 deaths should have priority for a vaccine. High trust in Dr. Fauci as a source of COVID-19 vaccine information was associated with factors similar to high trust in MS. Fair, equitable, and transparent access and distribution are essential to ensure trust in public health systems¡¯ abilities to serve the population.","Latkin, Carl A.; Dayton, Lauren, Miller, Jacob R.; Yi, Grace, Jaleel, Afareen, Nwosu, Chikaodinaka C.; Yang, Cui, Falade-Nwulia, Oluwaseun",,MDPI,,20210422.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/bs11040056,covidwho-1194608,,4,Behavioral Sciences,en,,2021.0,"Behavioral Sciences; 11(4):56, 2021.",Behavioral and Attitudinal Correlates of Trusted Sources of COVID-19 Vaccine Information in the US,article,,,11
"INTRODUCTION Prompted by reports of thromboembolic events - some with fatal outcomes - among people who had received the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine from Oxford-AstraZeneca against COVID-19, a number of European countries paused vaccination with this vaccine in early and mid-March 2021. Prior studies have suggested that vaccine willingness is highly dependent on public trust in the safety of vaccines. We therefore investigated whether vaccine willingness dropped in the wake of the reported cases of thromboembolic events in relation to the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS Using longitudinal survey data from Denmark, we compared vaccine willingness shortly before and after the reported cases of thromboembolic events, as well as the perceived safety of the two most widely used COVID-19 vaccines in Denmark - those from Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca - in the wake of these events. RESULTS We found sustained vaccine willingness after the reported cases of thromboembolic events (89% both before and after). However, the safety of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine was perceived to be significantly and substantially lower than the safety of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech, and this difference was particularly pronounced among those who were vaccine-hesitant. CONCLUSIONS The vaccine willingness of Danes does not seem to have been affected by the reports of thromboembolic events in relation to the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. FUNDING The study was funded by a grant from the Novo Nordisk Foundation (grant number: NNF20SA0062874). TRIAL REGISTRATION not relevant.","Sonderskov, K. M.; Dinesen, P. T.; Ostergaard, S.

"How do attitudes toward vaccination change over the course of a public health crisis? We report results from a longitudinal survey of United States residents during six months (March 16 -August 16, 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic. Contrary to past research suggesting that the increased salience of a disease threat should improve attitudes toward vaccines, we observed a decrease in intentions of getting a COVID-19 vaccine when one becomes available. We further found a decline in general vaccine attitudes and intentions of getting the influenza vaccine. Analyses of heterogeneity indicated that this decline is driven by participants who identify as Republicans, who showed a negative trend in vaccine attitudes and intentions, whereas Democrats remained largely stable. Consistent with research on risk perception and behavior, those with less favorable attitudes toward a COVID-19 vaccination also perceived the virus to be less threatening. We provide suggestive evidence that differential exposure to media channels and social networks could explain the observed asymmetric polarization between self-identified Democrats and Republicans.","Fridman, Ariel; Gershon, Rachel; Gneezy, Ayelet",,MEDLINE,"Attitude to Health; COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; COVID-19/psychology; Vaccination/psychology; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Female; Humans; Intention; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics/prevention &amp;amp; control; Politics; Public Health; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; SARS-CoV-2/isolation &amp;amp; purification; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States/epidemiology; Vaccination/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data",20210420.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250123,covidwho-1190172,1932-6203,4,PLoS One,en,US,2021.0,"PLoS One;16(4): e0250123, 2021.

"INTRODUCTION: While discussions on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines continue, healthcare professionals&#039; attitudes and their growing fear and anxiety during the pandemic process are not yet fully known. In this study, we aimed to investigate the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and affecting factors in healthcare professionals. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional online survey conducted in 1574 healthcare professionals consisting of physicians, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, and healthcare personnel in Turkey in December 2020. Demographic, attitudinal, and Fear of COVID-19 Scale scores of healthcare professionals were investigated in this survey. RESULTS: About 84.6% of healthcare professionals declared willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine whenever possible. Most physicians (90.4%) stated to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, while 66.5% of nurses, 73.9% of healthcare personnel, also preferred to have it as soon as the vaccine was available. Factors affecting the willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine were found to be advanced age, male gender, working in a primary health care center, living with family, having a child, having a chronic disease, having high Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FC-19S) scores. While the group with the highest vaccine rejection rate was nurses with 33.5%, FC-19S scores were significantly higher in nurses who wanted to be vaccinated. In multivariate regression analyses, factors related to the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine were identified as advanced age, routine adult vaccination, no history of COVID-19, and recommendation of the COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSION: A high proportion of healthcare professionals declared their willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine, and hence, this will play a leading role in optimizing the vaccination rate of the entire population while combating the pandemic.","Kaplan, Askin Keskin; Sahin, Mustafa Kursat; Parildar, Hulya; Adadan Guvenc, Isil",,MEDLINE,,20210420.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14226,covidwho-1189688,1742-1241,,Int J Clin Pract,en,GB,2021.0,"Int J Clin Pract;: e14226, 2021 Apr 16.

"Developing an effective and safe vaccine against Covid-19 will facilitate return to normal. Due to hesitation toward the vaccine, it is crucial to explore the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine to the public and healthcare workers. In this cross-sectional survey, we invited 2251 pediatricians and 506 (22%) of them responded survey and 424 (84%) gave either nasopharyngeal swap or antibody assay for COVID-19 and 71 (14%) of them got diagnosis of COVID-19. If the effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine was launched on market, 420 (83%) of pediatrician accepted to get vaccine shot, 422 (83%) of them recommended vaccination to their family members, 380 (75%) of them accepted to vaccine their children and 445 (85%) of them offered vaccination to their pediatric patients. Among the participated pediatricians 304 (60%) of them thought COVID-19 vaccine should be mandatory. We found that there are high COVID-19 vaccine willingness rates for pediatricians for themselves, their own children, family members and their pediatric patients. We also found that being a pediatric subspecialist, believing in achieving an effective vaccine, willingness to participate in the phase 1-2 clinical vaccine trial, willingness to get an influenza shot this season, believing a vaccine and vaccine passport should be mandatory were significant factors in accepting the vaccine. It is important to share all information about COVID-19 vaccines, especially effectiveness and safety, with the public in a clear communication and transparency. The opposite will contribute to vaccine hesitancy and anti-vaccine movement.","G?n¨¹ll¨¹, Erdem; Soysal, Ahmet; Atici, Serkan; Engin, Mesut; Yesilbas, Osman; Kasap, Tuba; Fedakar, Atiye; Bilgi?, Emre; Tavil, Emine Bet¨¹l; Tutak, Ercan; Yildiz, Ismail; Ak?ay, Teoman; Agladioglu, Sebahat Yilmaz; Tun?, Turan; Can, Ilkay; Karab?c¨¹oglu, Metin; Karabayir, Nalan",,MEDLINE,,20210420.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1896319,covidwho-1189405,2164-554X,,Hum Vaccin Immunother,en,US,2021.0,"Hum Vaccin Immunother;: 1-8, 2021 Apr 16.

"Background Health campaign interventions, particularly those tailored to the target audience¡¯s needs and preferences, can cost-effectively change people¡¯s attitudes and behaviors towards better health decision-making. However, there is limited research on how to best tailor seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns for young adults. Vaccination is vital in protecting young adults and their social circles (vulnerable populations like older adults) from the influenza virus and critical in shaping these emerging adults¡¯ vaccination habits in the long run. However, amid the prevalence of easily-accessible, attention-grabbing, and often malicious false and misinformation (e.g., COVID-19 vaccine conspiracy theories), it may be more challenging to develop vaccination messages that resonate with young adults well enough to attract their attention. Therefore, to bridge the research gap, this study examines young adults¡¯ preferences for seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns to inform effective intervention design and development. Methods Qualitative survey questions were developed to gauge young adults¡¯ preferences for seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns. A total of 545 young adults (73.9% female, Mage= 19.89, SD = 1.44) from a large University offered complete answers to a cross-sectional online survey. Braun and Clarke¡¯s thematic analysis procedures were adopted to guide the data analysis process. Results Thematic analysis revealed that young adults prefer seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns that rely on (1) quality and balanced information from (2) credible information sources, positioned in the (3) relevant health contexts, (4) emphasize actionable messages, and incorporate (5) persuasive campaign design. Interestingly, while many participants indicated the importance of fear-appeal messages in persuading them to take health actions, some young adults also suggested avoiding fear campaigns due to discomfort. Conclusions Insights of the study can inform seasonal influenza vaccination design and development, and have the potential to shed light on vaccination messaging in other vaccine contexts, such as COVID-19 vaccines. Results also underscore the need for health experts and government officials to adopt a more nuanced approach when selecting persuasive campaign appeals. While some young adults may resonate well with fear appeals, others may not. Future research could examine the underlying mechanisms that drive young adults¡¯ preference for vaccination campaign intervention to enrich the literature further.","Su, Zhaohui, McDonnell, Dean, Wen, Jun, Cheshmehzangi, Ali, Ahmad, Junaid, Goh, Edmund, Li, Xiaoshan, ?egalo, Sabina, Mackert, Michael, Xiang, Yu-Tao, Wang, Peiyu",,ScienceDirect,,20210420.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2021.100261,covidwho-1188320,,,"Brain, Behavior, &amp; Immunity - Health",en,,2021.0,"Brain, Behavior, &amp; Immunity - Health;: 100261, 2021.",Young adults¡¯ preferences for influenza vaccination campaign messages: Implications for COVID-19 vaccine intervention design and development,article,,,
"Protection of healthcare workers (HCWs) against influenza is essential for patient health and a functional health system. The study aimed to analyze the demand for seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) among various groups of HCWs in a tertiary care hospital before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify their motives for this season&#039;s SIV. Before this influenza season (2020/21), the hospital management offered free SIV to all HCWs and promoted it on the internal network. Out of 4,167 HCWs, 630 HCWs expressed interest in SIV and were vaccinated in the hospital. They filled in a total of 603 self-administered pen-and-paper questionnaires. The mean age of the respondents (374 females and 229 males) was 45?¡À?12?years. Physicians accounted for 48% of the vaccinated persons but for only 24% (p &lt;?.001) of all HCWs to whom SIV was offered. Only 16% of respondents vaccinated this year also received SIV before the last season (2019/20), with the proportion of physicians (19%) being statistically significantly higher than that of non-physicians (13%, p =?.045) and the proportion of chronically ill HCWs (22%) being higher than that of healthy individuals (13%, p =?.004). Most frequently, respondents&#039; motivation to get vaccinated this year was self-protection (61%), that is concerns about contracting influenza together with COVID-19 or alone, followed by family protection (58%) and patient protection (53%). In conclusion, COVID-19 contributed to an increased demand for SIV among HCWs and the threat of contracting it together with influenza was the most frequent motive.","Step¨¢nek, Ladislav; Nakl¨¢dalov¨¢, Marie; Vildov¨¢, Helena; Borikov¨¢, Alena; Janos¨ªkov¨¢, Magdal¨¦na; Ivanov¨¢, Katerina",,MEDLINE,,20210419.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1911212,covidwho-1185561,2164-554X,,Hum Vaccin Immunother,en,US,2021.0,"Hum Vaccin Immunother;: 1-6, 2021 Apr 15.

"Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by an unpredictable disease course, with variable presentations of different organ systems. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are highly variable ranging from mild presentations to severe, life-threatening symptoms and the wide individual variability may be due to the broad heterogeneity in the underlying pathologies. There is no doubt that early management may have a major influence on the outcome. This led the scientists to search for ways to monitor disease progression or to predict outcomes in COVID-19. Although it is not yet possible to predict who will progress to the severe forms or in what time, numerous prospective and longitudinal studies represent the evidence for determining the potential immunological risk factors of COVID-19 critical disease and death. The kinetics and breadth of immune responses during COVID-19 appear to follow a trend which is consistent to the predominant pathological alterations. Recent publications have used these biomarkers to help identify patients who will develop the severe acute COVID-19. Of particular interest is the relationship between the kinetics of peripheral leukocytes and clinical progress of the disease in COVID-19. Although research is ongoing in this area, we present details about the current status of the evaluation. Understanding of the COVID-19 related alterations of the innate and adaptive immune responses may help to promote the vaccine development and immunological interventions.","Ghaebi, Mahnaz; Tahmasebi, Safa; Jozghorbani, Maryam; Sadeghi, Alireza; Thangavelu, Lakshmi; Zekiy, Angelina Olegovna; Esmaeilzadeh, Abdolreza",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/immunology; Leukocytes/immunology; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; COVID-19/etiology; COVID-19/pathology; COVID-19/therapy; Disease Progression; Humans; Immunity, Cellular; Immunity, Innate; Immunotherapy; Leukocyte Count; Leukocytes/pathology; Macrophages/immunology; Macrophages/pathology; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2/isolation &amp;amp; purification; T-Lymphocytes/immunology; T-Lymphocytes/pathology",20210419.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119503,covidwho-1185151,1879-0631,,Life Sci,en,NL,2021.0,"Life Sci;277: 119503, 2021 Jul 15.

"Background: Malaysia is no exception to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to date, there is no specific treatment to cure the dis-ease, and the vaccine is still not available. Hence, to stress the importance of practising protective measures. Objective: This study intended to examine the knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19 and its preventive measures among Malaysian amid the CMCO (Conditional Movement Control Order) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted online among Malaysians aged 18 years old and above from May to June 2020 using a self-developed questionnaire through snowball sampling. Results: A total of 571 respondents were analyzed. The average age was 26 years old, and monthly income was RM1500, about half were females (57.8%), had education level to undergraduate (58.1%), one-third were Indians (34.7%), one-fifth were Malays (23.6%), one-third from Sarawak (31.2%), and one-fifth from Selangor (25.0 %). The correct rate for all three outcome domains was high, 83% for knowledge, 85% for attitude, and 86% for practice. Few respondents still holding the myths regard-ing COVID-19. No significant factors contributed to the knowledge score. Factors that contributed to higher attitude scores were monthly income and employment status. Factors that contributed to higher practice scores were female, Chinese, and medical employees. The higher the knowledge score, the higher the attitude score and practice score. Conclusions: Malaysians discerned and optimistic about COVID-19, its preventive measures, and the implementation of MCO. They had confidence with the government in combating COVID-19 and were practising preventive measures. ? IJCRR.","Elias, R.; Vigayan, G. A. P.; Mohana Kumar, H. V. A. P.; Sevanesan, M. S. A.

"Background: The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) is recommended for all adults over the age of 65 to reduce S. pneumoniae pneumonia. Our institution follows a standing order for nurses to vaccinate adults who meet the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) criteria. During the COVID-19 pandemic surge, the pneumococcal vaccine and influenza vaccine nurse-driven protocol was determined to be non-essential on 3/23, and 4/2 respectively. Our study aims to characterize missed vaccine opportunities among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 during this surge. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study of PCR-positive COVID-19 patients admitted to an inner-city hospital and discharged alive between the dates of 3/23 and 4/21/2020. Patients under the age of 65 were excluded. Data collected included patient age, gender, race, length of stay, co-morbidities that would indicate a vaccine opportunity, prior vaccinations, and whether there was a vaccine opportunity for PPSV23 and influenza defined by ACIP indications. Vaccine history was evaluated using the electronic medical record (EMR) and Michigan Care Improvement Registry. If there was a vaccine opportunity, we documented whether a vaccine was given before hospital discharge. Total numbers of vaccines given for time periods in 2019 and 2020 were collected from EMR for comparison. Results: 100 patients over the age of 65 were included. The average age was 72.8 years, and most patients (66%) were of African American race. The mean length of stay was five days. 52 patients were identified as having an opportunity to receive PPSV23, and 0 patients received the vaccine. 67.3% had more than one indication for PPSV23. 37 patients were eligible to receive influenza vaccine, and 0 received the vaccine. Results are summarized in table 1. Figures 1 and 2 display the number of pneumococcal and influenza vaccines given per EMR, respectively. Conclusion: Due to prioritization of potential staffing shortages and clustering nursing care, an opportunity to vaccinate patients with pneumococcal and influenza vaccines was missed. It is important for health care providers to be aware of this potential opportunity for vaccination of high-risk patients in order to promote primary prevention in future waves of pandemics.","Shallal, A.; Vahia, A.

"BACKGROUND: Understanding concerns for receiving COVID-19 vaccines is key to ensuring appropriately tailored health communications to increase vaccine uptake. However, limited data exists about vaccine concerns among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI). METHODS: Data from the COVID-19 Effects on the Mental and Physical Health of AAPI Survey Study (COMPASS), a cross-sectional, national survey for AAPI adults in the U.S. were used (N=1,646). Descriptive statistics were used to assess sample characteristics including proportions of AAPI with various COVID-19 vaccine concerns, categorized as none, side-effects only, unsafe only, and multiple reasons, and differences in vaccine concerns by socio-demographics. Ordinary multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate associations between a characteristic and having any vaccine concerns. RESULTS: Overall, 76% of the respondents reported having at &amp;#8805;1 concerns about the vaccine. The most common concern was side effects (65%). Vietnamese Americans reported less concerns (vs. Chinese Americans). Those who were 30-39 and 40-49 years old (vs. &lt;30), females (vs. males), and experienced mild negative impacts from COVID-19 on family income/employment (vs. no change) reported more concerns about the vaccine. Those who had less vaccine concerns were those who reported higher (vs. low) health status, &amp;#8805;60 years old (vs. &lt;30), and separated/divorced/widowed (vs. single). DISCUSSION: AAPI is a diverse population and this study revealed differences in vaccine concerns across AAPI groups. Findings revealed potential targets for patient education needs. Effective strategies to address various vaccine concerns across subgroups of AAPI will be crucial to ensure equity in vaccination uptake.","Ta Park, Van; Dougan, Marcelle; Meyer, Oanh; Nam, Bora; Tzuang, Marian; Park, Linda; Vuong, Quyen; Tsoh, Janice",,MEDLINE,,20210416.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40615-021-01037-0,covidwho-1182350,2196-8837,,J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),en,CH,2021.0,J Racial Ethn Health Disparities;2021 Apr 14. ,Differences in COVID-19 Vaccine Concerns Among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders: The COMPASS Survey.,article,,,
"BACKGROUND: Vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become an important public health solution. To date, there has been a lack of data on COVID-19 vaccination willingness, vaccine hesitancy, and vaccination coverage in China since the vaccine has become available. METHODS: We designed and implemented a cross-sectional, population-based online survey to evaluate the willingness, hesitancy, and coverage of the COVID-19 vaccine among the Chinese population. 8742 valid samples were recruited and classified as the vaccine-priority group (n?=?3902; 44.6%) and the non-priority group (n?=?4840; 55.4%). RESULTS: The proportion of people&#039;s trust in the vaccine, delivery system, and government were 69.0%, 78.0% and 81.3%, respectively. 67.1% of the participants were reportedly willing to accept the COVID-19 vaccination, while 9.0% refused it. 834 (35.5%) reported vaccine hesitancy, including acceptors with doubts (48.8%), refusers (39.4%), and delayers (11.8%). The current coverage was 34.4%, far from reaching the requirements of herd immunity. The predicted rate of COVID-19 vaccination was 64.9%, 68.9% and 81.1% based on the rates of vaccine hesitancy, willingness, and refusal, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 vaccine rate is far from reaching the requirements of herd immunity, which will require more flexible and comprehensive efforts to improve the population&#039;s confidence and willingness to vaccinate. It should be highlighted that vaccination alone is insufficient to stop the pandemic; further efforts are needed not only to increase vaccination coverage but also to maintain non-specific prevention strategies.","Wang, Chao; Han, Bingfeng; Zhao, Tianshuo; Liu, Hanyu; Liu, Bei; Chen, Linyi; Xie, Mingzhu; Liu, Jiang; Zheng, Hui; Zhang, Sihui; Wang, Yu; Huang, Ninghua; Du, Juan; Liu, Ya-Qiong; Lu, Qing-Bin; Cui, Fuqiang",,MEDLINE,COVID-19; Vaccines; COVID-19 Vaccines; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination,20210415.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.04.020,covidwho-1180090,1873-2518,21,Vaccine,en,NL,2021.0,"Vaccine;39(21): 2833-2842, 2021 05 18.

"BACKGROUND: Determinants of vaccine acceptance are multifactorial, complex, and in most cases, context-dependent. We determined the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination intention (VI) and fear of its adverse effects (FAE) as well as their associated factors in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). METHODS: We conducted a secondary cross-sectional analysis of a database collected by the University of Maryland and Facebook. We included participants aged 18 and over from LAC surveyed, January 15 to February 1, 2021. We evaluated VI, FAE, sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 symptomatology, compliance with community mitigation strategies, food and economic insecurity, mental health evaluation and the influence in VI when recommended by different stakeholders. We calculated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios with their 95%CIs. RESULTS: We analyzed 472,521 responses by Latin American adults, finding a VI and FAE prevalence of 80.0% and 81.2%, respectively. We found that female and non-binary genders were associated with a lower probability of VI and a higher probability of FAE. Besides, living in a town, village or rural area and economic insecurity was associated with a higher FAE probability. The fears of becoming seriously ill, a family member becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 and having depressive symptoms were associated with a higher probability of VI and FAE. CONCLUSION: Eight out of 10 adults in LAC have VI and FAE. The factors identified are useful for the development of communication strategies to reduce FAE frequency. It is necessary to guarantee mass vaccination and support the return of economic activities.","Urrunaga-Pastor, Diego; Bendezu-Quispe, Guido; Herrera-A?azco, Percy; Uyen-Cateriano, Angela; Toro-Huamanchumo, Carlos J; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J; Hernandez, Adrian V; Benites-Zapata, Vicente A",,MEDLINE,COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Vaccination/psychology; Vaccination/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; COVID-19/epidemiology; COVID-19/psychology; Caribbean Region/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Intention; Latin America/epidemiology; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Perception; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination Refusal/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Young Adult,20210415.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2021.102059,covidwho-1180060,1873-0442,,Travel Med Infect Dis,en,NL,2021.0,"Travel Med Infect Dis;41: 102059, 2021.

"Background: The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic is overstressing health systems and Essential health services and vaccination services are disrupted. Immunization is a confirmed gizmo for governing and even eliminating communicable diseases. Objective: This study aims to assess the challenge and status of immunization during COVID-19 and associated factors among children aged 10-23 months south Nation Nationality and People Region Ethiopia. Methods and Materials: community-based mixed quantitative and qualitative cross-sectional study was done in southwest Ethiopia. Data was collected using semi-structured questionnaires and in-depth interviews. After that, the data were edited, coded, and move in into Epi info version 7.2 for data management then transported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. The analyzed data were presented by tables, graphs, figures, and text form. Results: According to this study, the prevalence of incomplete immunization was found to be 809 (62.2%) with (95% CI: 59.5, 64.8). In multivariable analysis waiting time at a health facility (AOR=0.04, 95% CI 0.0001,0.004), education (AOR=5.08,95% CI2.31,11.14), place of delivery (AOR=2.34,95% CI 4.96,6.089), fearing of COVID-19 (AOR=3.62,95% CI 1.72,7.64) and do not understand the separation care of COVID-19 and other health services (AOR=2.85,95% CI1.38,5.9) were significantly associated factors. Conclusion: The prevalence of incomplete immunization among children aged 10-23 months was very high in this study as compared to the other studies done in a different pocket of Ethiopia. Consecutively, reducing waiting time at a health facility, avoiding unnecessary fear of COVID-19, and promoting immunization in a different area of southwest Ethiopia along with health extension workers are recommended.","Tegegne, A.

"OBJECTIVE: To measure COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and related factors to undercover nurses&#039; concerns and fears. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SAMPLE: The study included 639 nurses; 83% were women and 80% under 50?years. MEASUREMENT: A self-administered questionnaire was used. It included demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related fears and concerns, COVID-19 vaccine perceived benefits, and intention toward getting the vaccine. RESULTS: Forty percent of the nurses planned to get the vaccine when available, 41% would take it later when adequate protection and safety were presented, and 18% would never take it. Significant factors associated with vaccination intention were as follows: age (adjusted OR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.02-1.99); lack of knowledge about the vaccine (adjusted OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.81-3.8); concern about long-term side effects (adjusted OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4-2.9); fear of injection (adjusted OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.04-2.13); natural immunity preference (adjusted OR 5.8, 95% CI 4.5-8.3); media misrepresentation (adjusted OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.4); and getting COVID-19 from the vaccine (adjusted OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.1). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccine safety and side-effects concerns impact nurses&#039; intentions to accept the vaccine and may result in low acceptance rates.

"Background and Aim: Increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients induced temporary redistribution and reorganization. Elective admittance for therapeutic purposes has been postponed for a very short period. We have transformed our daily practice with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) population to telephone visits for prevention of infection. This document was designed to represent the PAH patients course, relation with COVID-19 and quality of life (QOL) during pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 75 patients with PAH during COVID-19 pandemic. Demographic data including age, sex, duration of illness, duration on medical treatment were collected. QOL was assessed using the World Health Organization Quality of life-BREF(WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire. Four domains (physical, psychological, social, environmental) of the WHOQOL-BREF were the primary end points. Each item is rated by a 5-point Likert scale. Higher score reflects a better QOL. Bivariate relationship between sociodemographic factors and QOL scores were analyzed using independent samples t-test. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine independent predictors of QOL. Also second questionnaire was conducted for collecting the data during pandemic regarding the application to hospital due to PAH spesific/COVID related symptoms, hospital stay, COVID-19 PCR results if implemented, vaccine history. Results: 75 respondents&#039; distrubution has demonstrated as followed: 38.6% idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension;1.33% drugs and toxins induced;33.3% connective tissue disease associated;6.6% PAH after the correction of the congenital defect without any residual shunt, 20% Eisenmenger patients. Mean age was 53.54¡À15.02.The majority of the patients were married (60%), retired due to disability (46.6%), and educated (58.6%). Cronbach&#039;s alpha for all 26 questions of WHOQOL-BREF was acceptable (0.892). The following values of Cronbach&#039;s alpha for each domain: physical (0.926), psychological (0.871), social (0.782), environmental (0.820). Following QOL scores were recorded: physical (47.16¡À15.34), psychological (54.1¡À17.52), social (46.3¡À19.64), environmental domain (45.9¡À17.79). Younger age and being married was associated with a better QOL score in the social domain (p=0.012, p=0.005). Employed patients scored better in the environmental domain (p=0.027). Unemployed patients had significantly low scores in overall perception of health (p&amp;lt;0.05) as compared to other groups. Advanced functional class was found to be the only independent negative predictor of QOL in patients with PAH (p&amp;lt;0.05). Conclusions: Patients with PAH had overall low QOL scores in all four domains during COVID-19 pandemic. None of the patients diagnosed as COVID-19. Considerable amount of patients (65%) administered self-isolation from the beginning of the COVID-19.But this self-isolation rendered the patients&#039; mood to a more depressive and hopeless state.

"Two samples of 227 and 214 adults completed surveys of social support, perceived risk of COVID-19 and COVID-19 preventive activity - in Study 1 likelihood of testing was examined and in Study 2 likelihood of both testing and vaccination were examined during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. Path analysis showed, in Study 1, that access to help (as an indicator of social support) had a direct effect on likelihood of testing and indirect effects through self-efficacy, perceived risk and preventive behavior; and, in Study 2, that neighborhood identification (as an indicator of social support) had a direct effect on likelihood of testing and indirect effects on likelihood of both testing and vaccination through the mediators of strength of social network, loneliness, perceived risk of COVID-19, and preventive activity. Both studies suggest that level of social support (conceptualized in different ways) is an important determinant of COVID-19 testing and Study 2 shows it is also a determinant of likelihood of vaccination. As resurgences of COVID-19 occur, it will be necessary to monitor the likelihood of COVID-19 testing and vaccination behaviors and, especially, to promote confidence in the latter in individuals with decreased access to social support.","Jaspal, Rusi; Breakwell, Glynis M",,MEDLINE,,20210413.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01681-z,covidwho-1174011,1046-1310,,Curr Psychol,en,US,2021.0,"Curr Psychol;: 1-13, 2021 Apr 08.

"BACKGROUND: According to the recommendation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), getting influenza vaccines during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemics is especially important for people with certain underlying medical conditions, like cancer. Due to the similarities between the symptoms of influenza and COVID-19, receiving the flu vaccine in suspicious cases can be helpful because it will make it easier to request a medical test and diagnosis. In this study, the value of influenza vaccination in the cancer population was investigated. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, all cancer patients who were referred to our clinic and had eligibility to receive the flu vaccine were included in our study for following up clinical signs every week for one month. All patients who were vaccinated from October 1 to November 15, 2020 were investigated. The most side effects that were followed were fever, runny nose, bone pain, and life-threatening or persistent adverse effects. RESULTS: From a total of 288 patients (median age: 52 years (range 18-79), 112 (38.9%) males and 176 (61.1%) female) with different types of cancers, only two patients had an adverse effect of vaccination (including bone pain, runny nose, and fatigue), and one had COVID-19 ten days after vaccination. The rest of the patients did not show any side effects due to flu vaccination after one month of follow-up. Cancer patients are recommended to receive the flu vaccine annually during the pandemic and after the end of this pandemic, usually during the flu epidemic season to reduce mortality.","Aznab, Mozaffar; Eskandari Roozbahani, Narges; Moazen, Homa",,MEDLINE,,20210413.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00520-021-06204-x,covidwho-1173919,1433-7339,,Support. care cancer,en,DE,2021.0,Support Care Cancer;2021 Apr 10. ,Value of influenza vaccines in cancer patients during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic: a cross-sectional study.,article,,,
"Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health threat facing mankind. There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19, and many vaccine candidates are currently under clinical trials. This study aimed to understand the perception of social media users regarding a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria. Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional survey among social media users in Nigeria in August 2020 using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire includes sections on the demographic characteristics of the respondents and their perception regarding a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 517 respondents completed and returned the informed consent along with the questionnaire electronically. Data were coded and abstracted into Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and loaded into the STATA 14 software for final analysis. Results: the results showed that more than half of the respondents were male 294 (56.9%). Most of the respondents 385 (74.5%) intend to take the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available. Among the 132 respondents that would not take the COVID-19 vaccine, the major reason for non-acceptance was unreliability of the clinical trials 49 (37.1%), followed by the belief that their immune system is sufficient to combat the virus 36 (27.3%). We found a significant association between the age of the respondents and the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (P-value=0.00) as well as geographical location and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (P-value=0.02). Conclusion: it was observed that most of the respondents were willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Our findings also reiterate the need to reassure the public the benefits an effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine can reap for public health. There is a need for national health authorities in Nigeria to ensure public trust is earned and all communities, including the marginalized populations, are properly engaged to ensure an optimal COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.","Adebisi, Yusuff Adebayo; Alaran, Aishat Jumoke; Bolarinwa, Obasanjo Afolabi; Akande-Sholabi, Wuraola; Lucero-Prisno, Don Eliseo",,MEDLINE,COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Social Media/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Intention; Male; Middle Aged; Nigeria; Perception; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination/psychology; Young Adult,20210413.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2021.38.230.27325,covidwho-1175758,1937-8688,,Pan Afr Med J,en,UG,2021.0,"Pan Afr Med J;38: 230, 2021.

"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in a rural district of South India, six months after the index case. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 509 adults aged more than 18 years. From all the four subdistricts, two grampanchayats (administrative cluster of 5-8 villages) were randomly selected followed by one village through convenience. The participants were invited for the study to the community-based study kiosk set up in all the eight villages through village health committees. We collected socio-demographic characteristics and symptoms using a mobile application-based questionnaire, and we tested samples for the presence of IgG antibodies for SARS CoV-2 using an electro chemiluminescent immunoassay. We calculated age-gender adjusted and test performance adjusted seroprevalence. RESULTS: The age-and gender-adjusted seroprevalence was 8.5% (95% CI 6.9%- 10.8%). The unadjusted seroprevalence among participants with hypertension and diabetes was 16.3% (95% CI:9.2-25.8) and 10.7% (95% CI: 5.5-18.3) respectively. When we adjusted for the test performance, the seroprevalence was 6.1% (95% CI 4.02-8.17). The study estimated 7 (95% CI 1:4.5-1:9) undetected infected individuals for every RT-PCR confirmed case. Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) was calculated as 12.38 per 10000 infections as on 22 October 2020. History of self-reported symptoms and education were significantly associated with positive status (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of the rural population in a district of south India remains susceptible to COVID-19. A higher proportion of susceptible, relatively higher IFR and a poor tertiary healthcare network stress the importance of sustaining the public health measures and promoting early access to the vaccine are crucial to preserving the health of this population.

"The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the worst global crisis. Since no successful treatment and vaccine have been reported, efforts to improve the public&#039;s knowledge, attitudes, and practices are critical to reducing the spread of COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the general public knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding COVID-19. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in three developing countries (China, India, and Pakistan). The reason for choosing only three countries is to identify the cross-border effect statistically and data collection constraints. The IBM SPSS version 23.0 was used for descriptive, univariate, and multivariate analysis of the study. One thousand one hundred and sixty participants completed the study, one-quarter of them were female, and three-quarters were male. The study&#039;s findings evidenced that the knowledge and attitude correlation was 58.4% and between knowledge and practices 18.2%. Furthermore, the knowledge was found lower in females, among India and Pakistan, and people aged less and equivalent to 30 years. The attitudes among respondents were found poorer among unmarried females and India and Pakistan residents. While the practices found lower among employed, unemployed and, respondents had a bachelor&#039;s degree, and females reside in India. And future studies should focus on factors that influence the government regarding the imposition of lockdown, boost the economy in the pandemic, and motivate the general public to follow the health institution&#039;s instructions.","Qalati, Sikandar Ali; Ostic, Dragana; Fan, Mingyue; Dakhan, Sarfaraz Ahmed; Vela, Esthela Galvan; Zufar, Zuhaib; Sohu, Jan Muhammmad; Mei, Jinlan; Thuy, Troung Thi Hong",,MEDLINE,,20210413.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0272684X211004945,covidwho-1175233,1541-3519,,Int Q Community Health Educ,en,US,2021.0,"Int Q Community Health Educ;: 272684X211004945, 2021 Apr 08.

"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of infections, prevalence of hospitalisation due to infections, the vaccination status and perceived screening of infections prior to the start of biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) of a patient cohort with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases (CIRD). METHODS: Consecutive CIRD patients reporting to our specialised centre were prospectively included (n=975) in this cross-sectional study. Data on comorbidities including infections, treatment, vaccination status, screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and hepatitis B (HepB) were collected. Antibodies against measles and HepB were measured by ELISA. The vaccination status was assessed by a predefined vaccination score (0-26) categorising patients into four immunisation states: low (0-6), moderate (7-13), good (14-20), high (21-26). RESULTS: All patients on bDMARDs (n=499) were screened for LTBI, and 469 for HepB (94%). All LTBI patients (n=16) received isoniazid (3.2%) and 16 chronic HepB patients received lamivudine (3.4%). Protective measles specific IgG-antibodies were found in 901 patients (92.4%). Although 629 patients were educated about vaccination strategies (64.5%), only 540 showed a vaccination card (55.4%). Only 49% of patients had undergone pneumococcal vaccination and less than 30% were protected against HepB and influenza, while 7.6% have not protective antibody titres against measles. No patient met the German national vaccination recommendations requiring a complete documentation of vaccines. The mean vaccination score was 13.3¡À4.2 with 5.7% of patients having a low, 43.9% a moderate, 47.0% a good and 3.3% a high score. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of CIRD patients are n0t sufficiently vaccinated against pneumococci, HepB, influenza and measles. Although CIRD patients and general practitioners regularly receive professional information about the need of vaccination, vaccination rates were low to moderate. Interdisciplinary quality projects should be planned to change that inacceptable result.","Kiltz, Uta; Celik, Aylin; Tsiami, Styliani; Buehring, Bjoern; Baraliakos, Xenofon; Andreica, Ioana; Kiefer, David; Braun, Juergen",,MEDLINE,,20210413.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/rmdopen-2020-001499,covidwho-1175192,2056-5933,1,,en,GB,2021.0,RMD Open;7(1)2021 04. ,Are patients with rheumatic diseases on immunosuppressive therapies protected against preventable infections?

"BACKGROUND: There are limited data on the transmission of influenza in the context of primary care practices, despite the fact that a significant proportion of the population consult their primary care physician for an influenza-like illness every year. AIM: To describe the use of influenza prevention and control methods in private practices of the Swiss sentinel network. METHODS: This online cross-sectional survey collected data about infection prevention and control measures in the 166 private practices of the Swiss sentinel surveillance network during the 2018-2019 influenza season. Questions pertained to the practice setting, infection prevention and control recommendations, influenza vaccination status of the physicians and their staff, adhesion to hand hygiene, and mask wearing. FINDINGS: Among the 122 practices that answered (response rate 73.5%), 90.2% of the responding physicians had been vaccinated themselves, and 46.7% (56/120) estimated that their staff vaccination coverage was &gt;60%, although it was offered to employees in all practices. Most practices (N=68, 55.7%) had no specific recommendations for their staff concerning mask wearing. Most physicians reported washing or disinfecting their hands before examining a patient (N=91, 74.6%), after examination (N=110, 90.2%) and before a medical procedure (N=112, 91.8%). However, this rate was lower for arrival at the practice (N=78, 63.9%) and leaving the practice (N=83, 68.0%). CONCLUSION: Most physicians in the Swiss sentinel surveillance network have been vaccinated themselves. However, the vaccination rates among their staff are low, despite vaccine availability. Hand hygiene measures were also suboptimal. These results warrant further efforts to implement infection prevention and control measures in the ambulatory setting.","Peytremann, A; Senn, N; Mueller, Y",,MEDLINE,,20210412.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.08.026,covidwho-743311,1532-2939,4,J Hosp Infect,en,GB,2020.0,"J Hosp Infect;106(4): 786-792, 2020 Dec.

"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccine development is proceeding at an unprecedented pace. Once COVID-19 vaccines become widely available, it will be necessary to maximize public vaccine acceptance and coverage. OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to analyze the predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Russia. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among Russian adults from September 26(th) to November 9(th), 2020. Predictors of the intent to take up COVID-19 vaccination were explored using logistic regression. RESULTS: Out of 876 participants, 365 (41.7%) would be willing to receive the vaccine if it became available. Acceptance increased for a vaccine with verified safety and effectiveness (63.2%). Intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was relatively higher among males (aOR=2.37, 95% CI 1.41-4.00), people with lower monthly income (aOR=2.94, 95%CI 1.32-6.57), and with positive trust in the healthcare system (aOR=2.73, 95% CI 1.76-4.24). The Russian people were more likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccine if they believed that the vaccine reduces the risk of virus infection (aOR=8.80, 95%CI 5.21-14.87) or relieves the complications of the disease (aOR=10.46, 95%CI 6.09-17.96). Other barriers such as being unconcerned about side-effects (aOR=1.65, 95%CI 1.03-2.65) and the effectiveness and safety of the vaccination (aOR=2.55, 95%CI 1.60-4.08), also affected acceptance. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed the usefulness of the health belief model constructs in understanding the COVID-19 vaccination acceptance rate in the Russian population. This rate was influenced by sociodemographic and health-related characteristics, and health beliefs. These findings might help guide future efforts for policymakers and stakeholders to improve vaccination rates by enhancing trust in the healthcare system.","Tran, V. D.; Pak, T. V.; Gribkova, E.

"The present study examined predictors of the intention to become vaccinated against Covid-19 among the Slovenian public. A cross-sectional, non-probability sample was collected through an online survey in March and April 2020 (N = 826;Mage=33.2 years). We tested four groups of predictors: demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, health status and political (left-right) orientation. Our ordinal regression model explained 44% of the variance in Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy. All six predictors had a significant impact on vaccine hesitancy, which was significantly higher among women, among 30-39-year-olds, the less educated, the self-employed and unemployed, those reporting excellent self-rated health and those with a centrist political orientation (followed by right-oriented respondents).

"ABSTRACT:  Objective: To investigate sociodemographic factors associated with the willingness to take the pandemic influenza vaccine.  Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of Brazilian civil servants participating in the fourth wave (2012-2013) of the longitudinal Pr¨®-Sa¨²de Study. Associations were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI), estimated by multivariate logistic regression models.  Results: Among 2,828 participants, 15.9% would not be willing to vaccinate in the future if the Brazilian Ministry of Health promoted a new vaccination campaign against pandemic influenza. Not willing to vaccinate in the future was strongly associated with not taking the pandemic influenza vaccine in 2010 (OR = 9.0, 95%CI 6.9 - 11.6). Among the unvaccinated, females, those aged &amp;gt; 60 years, and non-health care workers were less willing to vaccinate in the future. Again, in the vaccinated group, females were less willing to vaccinate.  Conclusion: Multidisciplinary efforts should be encouraged in order to identify reasons for refusing vaccination, focusing on the individual and group perceptions of susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers to vaccination.

"To control the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), COVID-19 vaccination has been quickly developed. However, the COVID-19 pandemic will not be controlled if the COVID-19 vaccination uptake willingness is low. Therefore, the study aim was to explore the COVID-19 vaccination uptake willingness among the outpatient population and healthcare workers in Taiwan during the worldwide pandemic period without community outbreaks. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among healthcare workers (HCWs; n = 500; mean age = 32.96 years) of National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH) and outpatients (n = 238; mean age = 34.43 years) arriving at NCKUH. We used an online survey conducted between September 24 and 21 November 2020, for healthcare workers, and between 27 October and 31 December 2020, for the outpatient sample. Information regarding willingness to receive vaccination, willingness to rapid test, fear of COVID-19, risk perception, and preventive behaviors was collected in both samples; information regarding willingness to care for patients was collected in healthcare workers. Willingness to receive vaccination was the main variable in the present study; willingness to rapid test, willingness to care for patients, fear of COVID-19, risk perception, and preventive behaviors were the secondary variables in the study. The factors associated with vaccination willingness were identified through logistic regression analysis. The participants&#039; willingness to receive vaccination was low for both healthcare workers (23.4%) and the outpatient sample (30.7%). Similarly, their willingness to take rapid tests was low (23.6% for healthcare workers and 28.6% for outpatient sample). Risk perception (crude odds ratio (COR) = 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03, 1.63), willingness to take rapid test (COR = 9.24; 95% CI = 5.76, 14.83), and preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors (COR = 2.32; 95% CI = 1.52, 3.56) were significant factors explaining the healthcare workers&#039; willingness to receive vaccination. Willingness to take a rapid test (COR = 8.91; 95% CI = 4.71, 16.87) and preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors (COR = 1.69; 95% CI = 1.09, 2.60) were significant factors explaining the outpatient sample&#039;s willingness to receive vaccination. Willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 among HCWs and outpatients is low due to the relatively safe status of COVID-19 infection in Taiwan. These findings can help policymakers advocate for the effectiveness of and provide transparent information on COVID-19 vaccination uptake in a country/region with a relatively safe COVID-19 outbreak status.","Kukreti, Shikha; Lu, Mei-Yun; Lin, Yi-Hsuan; Strong, Carol; Lin, Chung-Ying; Ko, Nai-Ying; Chen, Po-Lin; Ko, Wen-Chien",,MEDLINE,,20210408.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9030246,covidwho-1170475,2076-393X,3,,en,CH,2021.0,Vaccines (Basel);9(3)2021 Mar 12. ,Willingness of Taiwan&#039;s Healthcare Workers and Outpatients to Vaccinate against COVID-19 during a Period without Community Outbreaks.,article,,,9
"BACKGROUND: To investigate intention rates to get vaccinated against COVID-19 among healthcare personnel (HCP) in Greece. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey. RESULTS: The response rate was 14.5%. Of 1521 HCP with a known profession, 607 (39.9%) were nursing personnel, 480 (31.6%) physicians, 171 (11.2%) paramedical personnel, 72 (4.7%) supportive personnel, and 191 (12.6%) administrative personnel. Overall, 803 of 1571 HCP (51.1%) stated their intention to get vaccinated while 768 (48.9%) stated their intention to decline vaccination. Most HCP (71.3%) who reported intent to get vaccinated noted contributing to the control of the pandemic and protecting their families and themselves as their reasons, while the most common reason for reporting intent to decline vaccination was inadequate information about the vaccines (74.9%), followed by concerns about vaccine safety (36.2%). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the probability of intending to get vaccinated increased with male gender, being a physician, history of complete vaccination against hepatitis B, history of vaccination against pandemic A (H1N1) in 2009-2010, belief that COVID-19 vaccination should be mandatory for HCP, and increased confidence in vaccines in general during the COVID-19 pandemic. The following factors were associated with a lower intention to get vaccinated: no vaccination against influenza the past season, no intention to get vaccinated against influenza in 2020-2021, and no intention to recommend COVID-19 vaccination to high-risk patients. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need to built safety perception towards COVID-19 vaccines and raise vaccine uptake rates by HCP, and thus to protect the healthcare workforce and the healthcare services.","Maltezou, Helena C; Pavli, Androula; Dedoukou, Xanthi; Georgakopoulou, Theano; Raftopoulos, Vasilios; Drositis, Ioannis; Bolikas, Emmanouil; Ledda, Caterina; Adamis, Georgios; Spyrou, Andronikos; Karantoni, Eleni; Gamaletsou, Maria N; Koukou, Dimitra Maria; Lourida, Athanasia; Moussas, Nikolaos; Petrakis, Vasilios; Panagopoulos, Periklis; Hatzigeorgiou, Dimitrios; Theodoridou, Maria; Lazanas, Marios; Gargalianos, Panagiotis; Sipsas, Nikolaos V",,MEDLINE,,20210407.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idh.2021.03.002,covidwho-1163834,2468-0869,,Infect.

"BACKGROUND: Data suggest that there were disparities in H1N1 vaccine uptake, and these may inform COVID-19 vaccination efforts. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate disparities in H1N1 vaccine uptake, factors contributing to disparities, and interventions to reduce them. METHODS: We searched English-language articles in MEDLINE ALL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from database inception through May 8, 2020. Observational studies examining H1N1 vaccine uptake by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, rurality, and disability status in US settings were included. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility. Single-reviewer data abstraction was confirmed by a second reviewer. We conducted independent dual quality assessment, and collective strength of evidence assessment. RESULTS: We included 21 studies. African American/Black, Latino, and low-socioeconomic status participants had disproportionately lower H1N1 vaccination rates (low- to moderate-strength evidence). However, Latinos were more likely than Whites to intend to be vaccinated, and African American/Blacks and participants with lower-socioeconomic status were just as likely to intend to be vaccinated as their White and higher-socioeconomic status counterparts (low-strength evidence). Vaccine uptake for other groups has been insufficiently studied. Factors potentially contributing to disparities in vaccine uptake included barriers to vaccine access, inadequate information, and concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy. Studies were largely cross-sectional. Many of the studies are a decade old and were conducted in the context of a different pandemic. The categorization of racial and ethnic groups was not consistent across studies and not all groups were well-studied. DISCUSSION: Efforts to avoid disparities in COVID-19 vaccination uptake should prioritize vaccine accessibility and convenience in African American/Black, Latino, and low-SES communities; engage trusted stakeholders to share vaccine information; and address concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy.

"While the problem of vaccine hesitancy is not new, it has become more pronounced with the new COVID-19 vaccines and represents an obstacle to resolving the crisis. Even people who would usually trust vaccines and experts now prefer to wait for more information. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Slovenia in December 2020 to find out the attitudes of the population regarding COVID-19 vaccination and the factors that affect these attitudes. Based on 12,042 fully completed questionnaires, we find that higher intention to get vaccinated is associated with men, older respondents, physicians and medical students, respondents who got the influenza vaccination, those who knew someone who had gotten hospitalised or died from COVID-19 and those who have more trust in experts, institutions and vaccines. Nurses and technicians were less likely to get vaccinated. In answers to an open question, sceptics were split into those doubting the quality due to the rapid development of the vaccine and those that reported personal experiences with side effects of prior vaccinations. Although the Slovenian population is diverse in its attitudes towards vaccination, the results are comparable to those found in other countries. However, there are potential limitations to the generalizability of the findings that should be addressed in future studies.","Petravic, Luka; Arh, Rok; Gabrovec, Tina; Jazbec, Lucija; Rupcic, Nika; Staresinic, Nina; Zorman, Lea; Pretnar, Ajda; Srakar, Andrej; Zwitter, Matjaz; Slavec, Ana",,MEDLINE,,20210407.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9030247,covidwho-1167769,2076-393X,3,,en,CH,2021.0,Vaccines (Basel);9(3)2021 Mar 12. ,Factors Affecting Attitudes towards COVID-19 Vaccination: An Online Survey in Slovenia.,article,,,9
"The novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a global pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which elicits a wide variety of symptoms, ranging from mild to severe, with the potential to lead to death. Although used as the standard method to screen patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection, real-time PCR has challenges in dealing with asymptomatic patients and those with an undetectable viral load. Serological tests are therefore considered potent diagnostic tools to complement real-time PCR-based diagnosis and are used for surveillance of seroprevalence in populations. However, the dynamics of the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 currently remain to be investigated. Here, through analysis of plasma samples from 84 patients with COVID-19, we observed that the response of virus-specific antibodies against three important antigens, RBD, N and S, dynamically changed over time and reached a peak 5-8 weeks after the onset of symptoms. The antibody responses were irrespective of sex. Severe cases were found to have higher levels of antibody response, larger numbers of inflammatory cells and C-reactive protein levels. Within the mild/moderate cases, pairwise comparison indicated moderate association between anti-RBD vs. anti-N, anti-RBD vs. anti-S1S2, and anti-N vs. anti-S1S2. Furthermore, the majority of cases could achieve IgM and IgG seroconversion at 2 weeks since the disease onset. Analysis of neutralizing antibodies indicated that these responses were able to last for more than 112 days but decline significantly after the peak. In summary, our findings demonstrate the longitudinally dynamic changes in antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2, which can contribute to the knowledge of humoral immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection and are informative for future development of vaccine and antibody-based therapies.","Feng, Xia; Yin, Jiming; Zhang, Jiaying; Hu, Yaling; Ouyang, Yabo; Qiao, Shubin; Zhao, Hong; Zhang, Tong; Li, Xuemei; Zhang, Lili; Zhang, Jie; Jin, Ronghua; Feng, Yingmei; Su, Bin",,MEDLINE,"Antibodies, Neutralizing/blood; Antibodies, Viral/blood; COVID-19/immunology; Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Proteins/immunology; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus/immunology; Adult; Antibodies, Neutralizing/immunology; Antibodies, Viral/immunology; Beijing; COVID-19/pathology; China; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin G/blood; Immunoglobulin M/blood; Male; Middle Aged; Phosphoproteins/immunology; Protein Domains/immunology; Seroconversion; Severity of Illness Index; Tertiary Care Centers",20210407.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.614436,covidwho-1167338,1664-3224,,Front Immunol,en,CH,2021.0,"Front Immunol;12: 614436, 2021.

"Background: COVID-19 vaccine side effects have a fundamental role in public confidence in the vaccine and its uptake process. Thus far, the evidence on vaccine safety has exclusively been obtained from the manufacturer-sponsored studies;therefore, this study was designed to provide independent evidence on Pfizer¨CBioNTech COVID-19 vaccine side effects. Methods: A cross-sectional survey-based study was carried out between January and February 2021 to collect data on the side effects following the COVID-19 vaccine among healthcare workers in the Czech Republic. The study used a validated questionnaire with twenty-eight multiple-choice items covering the participants¡¯ demographic data, medical anamneses, COVID-19-related anamneses, general, oral, and skin-related side effects. Results: Injection site pain (89.8%), fatigue (62.2%), headache (45.6%), muscle pain (37.1%), and chills (33.9%) were the most commonly reported side effects. All the general side effects were more prevalent among the ¡Ü43-year-old group, and their duration was mainly one day (45.1%) or three days (35.8%) following the vaccine. Antihistamines were the most common drugs associated with side effects, thus requiring further investigation. The people with two doses were generally associated with a higher frequency of side effects. Conclusions: The distribution of side effects among Czech healthcare workers was highly consistent with the manufacturer¡¯s data, especially in terms of their association with the younger age group and the second dose. The overall prevalence of some local and systemic side effects was higher than the manufacturer¡¯s report.

"Political and public health leaders promoting COVID-19 vaccination should identify the most relevant criteria driving the vaccination decision. Social media is increasingly used as a source of vaccination data and as a powerful communication tool to increase vaccination. In December 2020, we performed a cross-sectional social media-based survey addressing personal sentiments toward COVID-19 vaccination in the USA. Our primary research objective is to identify socio-demographic characteristics and the reasons for the 1644 survey participants&#039; attitudes regarding vaccination. We present clear evidence that, contrary to the prevailing public perceptions, young audiences using social media have mostly a positive attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination (81.5%). These younger individuals want to protect their families and their relatives (96.7%); they see vaccination as an act of civic responsibility (91.9%) and express strong confidence in their healthcare providers (87.7%). Another critical factor is the younger population&#039;s fear of personal COVID-19 infection (88.2%); moreover, the greater the number of children the participants have, the greater is their intent to get the COVID-19 vaccine. These results enable a practical public-messaging pathway to reinforce vaccination campaigns addressing the younger population.","Benis, Arriel; Seidmann, Abraham; Ashkenazi, Shai",,MEDLINE,,20210406.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9040315,covidwho-1159076,2076-393X,4,,en,CH,2021.0,Vaccines (Basel);9(4)2021 Mar 29. ,Reasons for Taking the COVID-19 Vaccine by US Social Media Users.,article,,,9
"Healthcare workers (HCWs) due to their job profile are at utmost risk of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Serological survey is an useful tool for vulnerability mapping in an infectious disease pandemic. The aim of the current study was to assess seroprevalence of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 and its determinants among HCWs of a tertiary healthcare facility of India. It was an observational study, cross-sectional in design conducted among 919 HCWs of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, Bihar, India during September, 2020. In results, IgG seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 among the study subjects was 13.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 11.2-15.6%]. In univariate logistic regression analysis;gender, occupation, place of posting, use of full personal protective equipment (PPE), prior corona virus disease (COVID)-19 infection, influenza like illness (ILI), use of steam inhalation, consumption of azithromycin, zinc and vitamin C were the significant attributes which affected the IgG seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2. In the multivariable logistic regression model;occupation, place of posting, prior COVID-19 infection and ILI were significant determinants of IgG seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2. To conclude, majority of the HCWs were found to be IgG seronegative for SARS-CoV-2.

"Understanding whether members of the university population are willing to receive a future vaccination against COVID-19 and identifying barriers may help public health authorities to develop effective strategies and interventions to contain COVID-19. This cross-sectional study explored the willingness to accept a future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in a university population in Southern Italy. The perceived risk level of developing COVID-19 was 6.5 and it was significantly higher among females, younger subjects, and those who agreed/strongly agreed that COVID-19 is a severe disease. Only 21.4% of respondents were not worried at all regarding the safety of the vaccine. Males, not being married/cohabitant, being a faculty member, those who perceived a lower risk of developing COVID-19, and those who did not need information regarding the vaccination against COVID-19 were significantly more likely to have no concern at all regarding the safety of the vaccine. The vast majority (84.1%) were willing to receive a future vaccine against COVID-19. Almost coherently with predictors of concern on the safety of the vaccine, being male, not being married/cohabitant, being a faculty member, not being concerned at all that COVID-19 vaccination might not be safe, and agreeing that COVID-19 can have serious health consequences were significant predictors of the willingness to receive the vaccine against COVID-19. A considerable proportion of the population had a positive willingness to receive the future COVID-19 vaccine, although some concerns have been expressed regarding the effectiveness and safety and public health activities seem necessary to achieve the rate that can lead to the protection of the community.","Di Giuseppe, Gabriella; Pelullo, Concetta Paola; Della Polla, Giorgia; Pavia, Maria; Angelillo, Italo Francesco",,MEDLINE,,20210401.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9030275,covidwho-1158402,2076-393X,3,,en,CH,2021.0,Vaccines (Basel);9(3)2021 Mar 18. ,"Exploring the Willingness to Accept SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine in a University Population in Southern Italy, September to November 2020.",article,,,9
"BACKGROUND: The widespread COVID-19 vaccination program, issued by the Israel Government, provides a unique opportunity to examine psychiatric morbidity and vaccine attitudes among individuals who have already been vaccinated. Accordingly, the current study examined how vaccine hesitancy contributes to clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and peritraumatic stress among individuals who had received COVID-19 vaccinations. METHODS: We analyzed data obtained from 254 vaccinated individuals, and assessed vaccine hesitancy, depression, anxiety, and peritraumatic distress, as well as several demographic, health, and COVID-19-related factors. RESULTS: Logistic regressions demonstrated that above and beyond socio-demographic, health, and COVID-19-related factors, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was the most prominent risk factor for anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic distress. Higher levels of vaccine hesitancy were found to double the risk for depression and peritraumatic stress (ORs &gt; 2), and to triple the risk for anxiety (OR &gt; 3). LIMITATIONS: A cross-sectional design; a preliminary study requiring further investigation CONCLUSIONS: This study points to the importance of vaccine hesitancy among vaccinated populations and provides knowledge regarding its associations with negative psychiatric outcomes. These findings may offer important information for healthcare practitioners and policy makers in their attempt to encourage individuals to receive COVID-19 vaccinations and emphasize the need to further understand the underlying mechanisms of psychiatric morbidity among vaccinated individuals.","Palgi, Yuval; Bergman, Yoav S; Ben-David, Boaz; Bodner, Ehud",,MEDLINE,COVID-19; Vaccines; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Israel/epidemiology; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination,20210401.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.03.064,covidwho-1157446,1573-2517,,J Affect Disord,en,NL,2021.0,"J Affect Disord;287: 352-353, 2021 05 15.

"Aim: The objective of this study was to explore the public knowledge and attitudes towards COVID-19 Vaccination in Saudi Arabia. Methodology: This was an online, questionnaire-based cross-sectional study included a questionnaire that was prepared using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire was disseminated by social media platforms to be filled by the public in January 2021. Results: Most of the respondents were females (78.00%) and the age of the majority of them was less than 25 years old. Most of the respondents were aware of COVID-19 symptoms (94%), Aware of COVID-19 severity (91%), Aware of COVID-19 risk and negative outcomes (70%) and aware of vaccination necessity (68%). Only 37 % of them agreed that COVID-19 vaccination is effective and only 32% of them agreed that the vaccine is safe. Conclusion: The study showed that there was a good acceptability of the public of COVID-19 vaccination but the respondents are worried about the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Efforts to address these concerns and to improve vaccine usage are required. Additionally, targeted educational interventions are needed to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake of the future.","Ahmed, N.

"OBJECTIVES: Vaccination against COVID-19 emerges as an effective strategy for combating the pandemic. While many of our patients with rheumatic diseases (RD) wonder whether it is safe to get the vaccine, vaccine hesitancy is rising among the general population. We assessed the willingness to get vaccination and its probable predictors among patients with RD compared to healthcare workers and a sample from the general population. METHODS: We conducted a web-based questionnaire survey in a cross-sectional design in 3 groups of participants just before the mass vaccination program in Istanbul, Turkey. The questionnaire sought socio-demographic variables, COVID-19 related risk factors, willingness to get vaccination, and concerns and thoughts about vaccine. COVID-19 anxiety scale (CAS) was also evaluated. RESULTS: We studied in total 732 patients with RD (Group 1), 763 individuals representing general population (Group 2) and 320 hospital workers (Group 3). Dysfunctional anxiety related to COVID-19 was found in 4.9%, 3.8% and 4.1%, in Group 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Of the patients with RD, 29.2% were willing to be vaccinated, 19.0% were unwilling and 51.8% were undecided. These were somewhat similar among the general population (yes: 34.6%, no: 23.3% and unsure: 42.1%), with significantly less undecided individuals (p &lt; 0.001). On the other hand, hospital workers were significantly more willing (yes: 52.5%, no: 20.9% and unsure: 26.6%) (p &lt; 0.001). Main concerns were probable side effects, unknown scientific results and having no trust. Being male, older age, working in a hospital, not having contracted COVID-19 and high scores on CAS were found to be independently associated with willingness. CONCLUSIONS: The low rate of vaccine acceptance among patients with RD, as well as general population sampling is worrying. Healthcare policies should aim to implement communication, promote confidence and increase demand for COVID-19 vaccine.","Yurttas, Berna; Poyraz, Burc Cagri; Sut, Necdet; Ozdede, Ayse; Oztas, Mert; Ugurlu, Serdal; Tabak, Fehmi; Hamuryudan, Vedat; Seyahi, Emire",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; COVID-19/psychology; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Adult; COVID-19/epidemiology; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel/psychology; Health Personnel/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/psychology; Rheumatic Diseases/epidemiology; Rheumatic Diseases/psychology; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Turkey/epidemiology; Vaccination/psychology",20210331.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00296-021-04841-3,covidwho-1155267,1437-160X,6,Rheumatol Int,en,DE,2021.0,"Rheumatol Int;41(6): 1105-1114, 2021 06.

"The COVID-19 pandemic may be of particular concern for pregnant and breastfeeding women. We aimed to explore their beliefs about the coronavirus and COVID-19 vaccine willingness and to assess the impact of the pandemic on perinatal experiences and practices. A multinational, cross-sectional, web-based study was performed in six European countries between April and July 2020. The anonymous survey was promoted via social media. In total, 16,063 women participated (including 6661 pregnant and 9402 breastfeeding women). Most responses were collected from Belgium (44%), Norway (18%) and the Netherlands (16%), followed by Switzerland (11%), Ireland (10%) and the UK (3%). Despite differences between countries, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was identified among 40-50% of the respondents at the end of the first wave of the pandemic and was higher among pregnant women. Education level and employment status were associated with vaccine hesitancy. The first wave had an adverse impact on pregnancy experiences and disrupted access to health services and breastfeeding support for many women. In the future, access to health care and support should be maintained at all times. Evidence-based and tailored information on COVID-19 vaccines should also be provided to pregnant and breastfeeding women to avoid unfounded concerns about the vaccines and to support shared decision making in this population.","Ceulemans, Michael; Foulon, Veerle; Panchaud, Alice; Winterfeld, Ursula; Pomar, L¨¦o; Lambelet, Valentine; Cleary, Brian; O&#039;Shaughnessy, Fergal; Passier, Anneke; Richardson, Jonathan Luke; Allegaert, Karel; Nordeng, Hedvig",,MEDLINE,COVID-19; Pandemics; Belgium; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Europe; Female; Humans; Ireland; Netherlands; Norway; Pandemics/prevention &amp;amp; control; Pregnancy; SARS-CoV-2; Switzerland,20210330.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18073367,covidwho-1154395,1660-4601,7,Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),en,CH,2021.0,Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(7)2021 03 24. ,"Vaccine Willingness and Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Women&#039;s Perinatal Experiences and Practices-A Multinational, Cross-Sectional Study Covering the First Wave of the Pandemic.",article,,,18
"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The safety and immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine in older adults with different frailty and disability profiles have not been well determined. Our objective was to analyze immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in older adults across frailty and disability profiles. DESIGN: Multicenter longitudinal cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 134 residents aged &amp;#8805;65 years with different frailty and disability profiles in five long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in Albacete, Spain. INTERVENTION AND MEASUREMENTS: Residents were administered two vaccine doses as per the label, and antibody levels were determined 21.9 days (SD 9.3) after both the first and second dose. Functional variables were assessed using activities of daily living (Barthel Index), and frailty status was determined with the FRAIL instrument. Cognitive status and comorbidity were also evaluated. RESULTS: Mean age was 82.9 years (range 65-99), and 71.6% were female. The mean antibody titers in residents with and without previous COVID-19 infection were 49,878 AU/ml and 15,274 AU/ml, respectively (mean difference 34,604; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 27,699-41,509). No severe adverse reactions were observed, after either vaccine dose.

"Most research on vaccine hesitancy has focused on parental attitudes toward childhood vaccination, but it will be important to understand dimensions of vaccine hesitancy in the adult population as more adult vaccines are introduced in the future. We modified the Vaccine Hesitancy Scale to target adult vaccines and provide measures of its reliability and validity relative to influenza vaccine uptake and COVID-19 vaccination acceptance in cross-sectional internet surveys in the United States and in China. We assessed the impact of vaccine hesitancy on influenza and COVID-19 vaccination using multivariable regression modeling, which informed concurrent validity of the adult Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (aVHS). Among 1103 participants in the March 2020 China survey, 5.4% would not accept a COVID-19 vaccine, whereas this figure was 18.8% for the March 2020 US survey and 27.3% for the June 2020 US survey. The aVHS exhibits good internal consistency in all three surveys. Models adjusted for age, gender and income level show that prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was a fraction as high in those who scored higher on the VHS than those who scored lower on all three surveys. Prevalence of past and future flu vaccine acceptance was a fraction as high in those with higher aVHS scores than those with lower scores. Prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance is lower in those with higher vaccine hesitancy scores, which supports the scale&#039;s concurrent validity. The aVHS exhibits good internal consistency, making it a valid and reliable tool for measuring vaccination uptake.","Akel, Kaitlyn B; Masters, Nina B; Shih, Shu-Fang; Lu, Yihan; Wagner, Abram L",,MEDLINE,,20210330.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1884476,covidwho-1153053,2164-554X,,Hum Vaccin Immunother,en,US,2021.0,"Hum Vaccin Immunother;: 1-8, 2021 Mar 26.

"Innoculation of pneumococcal vaccines among the elderly is an effective public health policy to prevent pneumococcal diseases and it is widely promoted by many developed countries. The pneumococcal vaccination rate among the elderly in China was only 3.7% in 2019, it grew rapidly during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the psychological and demographic-economic factors related to the uptake behavior of pneumococcal vaccination among the Chinese elderly by using an integrated model based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), and knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP). The theoretical model was tested via structural equation modeling (SEM) with data collected from 516 Chinese older adults aged 60?years and older. Our results suggested that knowledge, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, attitude, and trust had a significant correlation with behavioral intention; behavioral intention and trust had a positive correlation with the uptake behavior, gender, and and education level and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exerted significant moderating effects. To increase the coverage of pneumococcal vaccination among the elderly, it is necessary to provide effective health education by authoritative experts, thereby enhancing their knowledge and positive attitude towardthe vaccination.","Zhou, Min; Zhan, Jiaying; Kong, Nan; Campy, Kathryn S; Chen, Yan",,MEDLINE,,20210330.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1905862,covidwho-1153004,1465-3966,,Psychol Health Med,en,GB,2021.0,"Psychol Health Med;: 1-15, 2021 Mar 26.

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants were first identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa, respectively, and have since spread to many countries. These variants harboring diverse mutations in the gene encoding the spike protein raise important concerns about their immune evasion potential. Here, we isolated infectious B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains from acutely infected individuals. We examined sensitivity of the two variants to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies present in sera and nasal swabs from individuals infected with previously circulating strains or who were recently vaccinated, in comparison with a D614G reference virus. We utilized a new rapid neutralization assay, based on reporter cells that become positive for GFP after overnight infection. Sera from 58 convalescent individuals collected up to 9 months after symptoms, similarly neutralized B.1.1.7 and D614G. In contrast, after 9 months, convalescent sera had a mean sixfold reduction in neutralizing titers, and 40% of the samples lacked any activity against B.1.351. Sera from 19 individuals vaccinated twice with Pfizer Cominarty, longitudinally tested up to 6 weeks after vaccination, were similarly potent against B.1.1.7 but less efficacious against B.1.351, when compared to D614G. Neutralizing titers increased after the second vaccine dose, but remained 14-fold lower against B.1.351. In contrast, sera from convalescent or vaccinated individuals similarly bound the three spike proteins in a flow cytometry-based serological assay. Neutralizing antibodies were rarely detected in nasal swabs from vaccinees. Thus, faster-spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants acquired a partial resistance to neutralizing antibodies generated by natural infection or vaccination, which was most frequently detected in individuals with low antibody levels. Our results indicate that B1.351, but not B.1.1.7, may increase the risk of infection in immunized individuals.","Planas, Delphine; Bruel, Timoth¨¦e; Grzelak, Ludivine; Guivel-Benhassine, Florence; Staropoli, Isabelle; Porrot, Fran?oise; Planchais, Cyril; Buchrieser, Julian; Rajah, Maaran Michael; Bishop, Elodie; Albert, M¨¦lanie; Donati, Flora; Prot, Matthieu; Behillil, Sylvie; Enouf, Vincent; Maquart, Marianne; Smati-Lafarge, Mounira; Varon, Emmanuelle; Schortgen, Fr¨¦d¨¦rique; Yahyaoui, Layla; Gonzalez, Maria; De S¨¨ze, J¨¦r?me; P¨¦r¨¦, H¨¦l¨¨ne; Veyer, David; S¨¨ve, Aymeric; Simon-Lori¨¨re, Etienne; Fafi-Kremer, Samira; Stefic, Karl; Mouquet, Hugo; Hocqueloux, Laurent; van der Werf, Sylvie; Prazuck, Thierry; Schwartz, Olivier",,MEDLINE,"Antibodies, Neutralizing/immunology; Antibodies, Viral/immunology; COVID-19/immunology; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; COVID-19 Vaccines/immunology; Convalescence; Cross Reactions; Humans; Neutralization Tests; Sensitivity and Specificity; Vaccination",20210330.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01318-5,covidwho-1152868,1546-170X,5,Nat Med,en,US,2021.0,"Nat Med;27(5): 917-924, 2021 05.

"Background The introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine necessitates the assessment of individual perception regarding the vaccine. This study aimed to assess the perception of community members and willingness to pay for the prospective COVID-19 vaccine in Ibadan, Nigeria. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study design was used. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire in September 2020. We studied community members aged 15 years and above using a multi-stage sampling technique. The perceptions of respondents about the COVID-19 vaccine were assessed on eight questions using the five-point Likert scale with a score point of ¡°1¡± assigned for ¡°Strongly Agree¡±, ¡°2¡± for ¡°Agree¡±, ¡°3¡± for ¡°Not decided¡±, ¡°4¡± for ¡°Disagree¡±, and ¡°5¡± for ¡°Strongly disagree¡±. During analysis, we reverse-coded the options by assigning a point of ¡°1¡± for ¡°Strongly disagree¡±, ¡°2¡± for ¡°Disagree¡±, ¡°3¡± for ¡°Not decided¡±, ¡°4¡± for ¡°Agree¡±, and ¡°5¡± for ¡°Strongly disagree¡±. However, questions asked in the negative directions were not reverse-coded during analysis. Eight questions were used to assess the perception of community members regarding the prospective COVID-19 vaccine, and overall, the maximum point was 40. Points greater than or equal to 32 points (80%) implied positive perception. Descriptive statistics were done. Chi-square tests were used for the assessment of associations between sociodemographic characteristics and willingness to pay for the prospective COVID-19 vaccine.

However, significant gaps were observed: only 68.2% knew that infected individuals may be asymptomatic; 45.4% believed that antibiotics are an effective treatment; and 55.4% stated that a vaccine has been developed (at the time of data collection). 71.9% believed or were uncertain that COVID-19 is a global conspiracy; 36.8% and 51% were afraid of contacting doctors and Chinese people, respectively. Further, 66.4% reported the pandemic had moderate to high negative effects on their mental health. Female gender, higher education and urban residents had significantly (p&amp;#8804;0.001) higher knowledge and practice scores. Further, we observed significant correlations between all KAP scores. CONCLUSIONS: Although the public have fair/good knowledge and practices regarding COVID-19, significant gaps should be addressed. Future awareness efforts should target less advantaged groups and future studies should develop new strategies to tackle COVID-19 negative mental health effects.","Masoud, Ahmed Taher; Zaazouee, Mohamed Sayed; Elsayed, Sarah Makram; Ragab, Khaled Mohamed; Kamal, Esraa M; Alnasser, Yusra T; Assar, Ahmed; Nourelden, Anas Z; Istatiah, Loai J; Abd-Elgawad, Mohamed M; Abdelsattar, Ahmed T; Sofy, Ahmed A; Hegazy, Doaa G; Fem¨ªa, Victor Z; Mendon?a, Adriana R; Sayed, Fatma M; Elmoursi, Ahmed; Alareidi, Alaa; Abd-Eltawab, Ahmed K; Abdelmonem, Mohamed; Mohammed, Omar M; Derballa, EzzEldeen A; El-Fas, Kareem A; Abdel-Daim, Mohamed M; Abushouk, Abdelrahman I",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19; Adult; Communicable Disease Control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires",20210329.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043971,covidwho-1150232,2044-6055,2,BMJ Open,en,GB,2021.0,"BMJ Open;11(2): e043971, 2021 02 23.

"CONTEXT: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 20 million cases and 350 000 deaths in the United States. With the ongoing media coverage and spread of misinformation, public health authorities need to identify effective strategies and create culturally appropriate and evidence-based messaging that best encourage preventive health behaviors to control the spread of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to understand the relationship between COVID-19 sources of information and knowledge, and how US adults&#039; knowledge may be associated with preventive health behaviors to help mitigate COVID-19 cases and deaths. DESIGN AND SETTING: For this cross-sectional study, survey data pertaining to COVID-19 were collected via online platform, Qualtrics, in February and May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Data responses included 718 US adults from the February survey and 672 US adults from the May survey-both representative of the US adult population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 knowledge score, COVID-19 reliable sources of information, and adherence to COVID-19 preventive health behaviors. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The main findings showed that disseminating COVID-19 information across various sources, particularly television, health care providers, and health officials, to increase people&#039;s COVID-19 knowledge contributes to greater adherence to infection prevention behaviors. Across February and May 2020 survey data, participants 55 years and older and those with higher educational background reported a higher average COVID-19 knowledge score. In addition, among the racial and ethnic categories, Black/African American and Native American/Alaska Native participants reported a lower average COVID-19 knowledge score than white participants-signaling the need to establish COVID-19 communication that is culturally-tailored and community-based. Overall, health care authorities must deliver clear and concise messaging about the importance of adhering to preventive health behaviors, even as COVID-19 vaccines become widely available to the general public. Health officials must also focus on increasing COVID-19 knowledge and dispelling misinformation.","Shafiq, Mehr; Elharake, Jad A; Malik, Amyn A; McFadden, SarahAnn M; Aguolu, Obianuju Genevieve; Omer, Saad B",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19 Vaccines; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; COVID-19/psychology; Health Behavior; Health Promotion/methods; Information Dissemination/methods; Pandemics/prevention &amp;amp; control; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; COVID-19/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States/epidemiology; Young Adult",20210329.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/PHH.0000000000001348,covidwho-1150042,1550-5022,3,J Public Health Manag Pract,en,US,2021.0,"J Public Health Manag Pract;27(3): 278-284, 2021.

"To investigate the associated factors underlying vaccination intentions for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), an online cross-sectional survey was conducted among adults 18 years or over in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Data were collected between 8 and 14 December 2020. A logistic regression analysis was employed to examine and identify the variables associated with vaccination intentions for COVID-19, with the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) also calculated. A total of 2137 respondents completed the questionnaire. Overall, about 48% of Saudi adults were willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Participants had stronger intentions to receive a vaccination if they resided in the southern region (OR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.21-3.14), received the seasonal influenza vaccination in the past (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.17-1.97), believed in mandatory COVID-19 vaccination (OR: 45.07; 95% CI: 31.91-63.65), or reported high levels of concern about contracting COVID-19 (OR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.29-2.81). Participants were less likely to have an intention to be vaccinated if they had a history of vaccine refusal (OR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.19-0.40). The low acceptance rate among the Saudi population should be targeted with multifaceted interventions aimed at raising awareness and emphasizing the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine.","Alfageeh, Eman Ibrahim; Alshareef, Noor; Angawi, Khadijah; Alhazmi, Fahad; Chirwa, Gowokani Chijere",,MEDLINE,,20210326.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9030226,covidwho-1148314,2076-393X,3,,en,CH,2021.0,Vaccines (Basel);9(3)2021 Mar 05. ,Acceptability of a COVID-19 Vaccine among the Saudi Population.,article,,,9
"BACKGROUND: High levels of vaccination coverage in populations will be required even with vaccines that have high levels of effectiveness to prevent and stop outbreaks of coronavirus. The World Health Organisation has suggested that governments take a proactive response to vaccine hesitancy &#039;hotspots&#039; based on social and behavioural insights. METHODS: Representative longitudinal online survey of over 3000 adults from Australia that examines the demographic, attitudinal, political and social attitudes and COVID-19 health behavior correlates of vaccine hesitance and resistance to a COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: Overall, 59% would definitely get the vaccine, 29% had low levels of hesitancy, 7% had high levels of hesitancy and 6% were resistant. Females, those living in disadvantaged areas, those who reported that risks of COVID-19 was overstated, those who had more populist views and higher levels of religiosity were more likely to be hesitant or resistant while those who had higher levels of household income, those who had higher levels of social distancing, who downloaded the COVID-Safe App, who had more confidence in their state or territory government or confidence in their hospitals, or were more supportive of migration were more likely to intend to get vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that vaccine hesitancy, which accounts for a significant proportion of the population can be addressed by public health messaging but for a significant minority of the population with strongly held beliefs, alternative policy measures may well be needed to achieve sufficient vaccination coverage to end the pandemic.","Edwards, Ben; Biddle, Nicholas; Gray, Matthew; Sollis, Kate",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/psychology; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; Vaccination Refusal/psychology; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Australia/epidemiology; COVID-19/epidemiology; COVID-19/psychology; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics/prevention &amp;amp; control; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Public Health/trends; Surveys and Questionnaires/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Vaccination/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Vaccination Refusal/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data",20210326.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248892,covidwho-1148250,1932-6203,3,PLoS One,en,US,2021.0,"PLoS One;16(3): e0248892, 2021.

"BACKGROUND: As the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic passed initial infection peak in Washington State, phased re-opening lifted stay-at-home orders and restrictions leading to increased non-essential work, social activities and gathering, especially among younger persons. METHODS: A longitudinal cohort analysis of Washington State Department of Health COVID-19 confirmed case age distribution 1) March-April 2020 (N = 13,934) and 2) March-August 2020 (N = 76,032) for proportional change over time using chi square tests for significance. RESULTS: From March 1st to April 19, 2020 COVID-19 age distribution shifted with a 10% decline in cases age 60 years and older and a 20% increase in age 0-19/20-39 years (chi-square = 223.10, p &lt; .001). Number of cases over the initial analysis period were 0-19 years n = 515, 20-39 years n = 4078, 40-59 years n = 4788, 60-79 years n = 3221, 80+ years n = 1332. After the peak (March 22, 2020), incidence declined in older age groups and increased among age 0-19 and 20-39 age groups from 20% to 40% of total cases by April 19 and 50% by May 3. During this time testing expanded with more testing among older age groups and less testing among younger age groups while case positivity shifted young. Percent positive cases age 0-19/20-39 years through August 2020 increased to a consistent average of 60% [age 0-19 increased to 19% (N = 10257), age 20-39 increased to 42% (N = 30215)]. CONCLUSIONS: An increased sustained proportion of COVID-19 incidence is present among children (age 0-19) and young adults (age 20-39) indicating an elevated role in disease spread during the epidemic creating a possible reservoir of disease with spillover risk to more vulnerable older persons and those with comorbid conditions.

"Aim: We aimed to investigate factors affecting the willingness and acceptance of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among adults in China and sources of knowledge about the vaccine.Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted from September 8th to 15th, 2020, comprising of 23 questions. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to examine factors associated with vaccination willingness and acceptance.Results: A total of 983 questionnaires were included and 81.3% of the participants were willing to receive the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. With a &quot;bachelor degree or above&quot; (OR = 0.56, p = 0.020) and believing that the vaccine would not cause SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR = 0.50, p = 0.003) were associated with an increased willingness. Aged :30 years (OR = 0.38, p = 0.001), and believing that the vaccine would not cause SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR = 0.52, p = 0.004) were associated with higher acceptance; while from Henan province (OR = 2.49, p &lt; 0.001), not willing to vaccinate (OR = 3.86, p &lt; 0.001), not suffering from chronic diseases (OR = 2.25, p = 0.013), and thinking it was not safe and effective in preventing COVID-19 (OR = 1.94, p = 0.001) were correlated with a lower acceptance.Conclusions: In conclusion, age, education, and vaccine perception might be key factors affecting the vaccine willingness and acceptance.

"BACKGROUND: During the early months of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, risks associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in pregnancy were uncertain. Pregnant patients can serve as a model for the success of clinical and public health responses during public health emergencies as they are typically in frequent contact with the medical system. Population-based estimates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections in pregnancy are unknown because of incomplete ascertainment of pregnancy status or inclusion of only single centers or hospitalized cases. Whether pregnant women were protected by the public health response or through their interactions with obstetrical providers in the early months of pandemic is not clearly understood. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate in pregnancy and to examine the disparities by race and ethnicity and English language proficiency in Washington State. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant patients with a polymerase chain reaction-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection diagnosed between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020 were identified within 35 hospitals and clinics, capturing 61% of annual deliveries in Washington State. Infection rates in pregnancy were estimated overall and by Washington State Accountable Community of Health region and cross-sectionally compared with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rates in similarly aged adults in Washington State. Race and ethnicity and language used for medical care of pregnant patients were compared with recent data from Washington State. RESULTS: A total of 240 pregnant patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections were identified during the study period with 70.7% from minority racial and ethnic groups. The principal findings in our study were as follows: (1) the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate was 13.9 per 1000 deliveries in pregnant patients (95% confidence interval, 8.3-23.2) compared with 7.3 per 1000 (95% confidence interval, 7.2-7.4) in adults aged 20 to 39 years in Washington State (rate ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.3); (2) the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate reduced to 11.3 per 1000 deliveries (95% confidence interval, 6.3-20.3) when excluding 45 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 detected through asymptomatic screening (rate ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-1.9); (3) the proportion of pregnant patients in non-White racial and ethnic groups with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 infection was 2- to 4-fold higher than the race and ethnicity distribution of women in Washington State who delivered live births in 2018; and (4) the proportion of pregnant patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection receiving medical care in a non-English language was higher than estimates of pregnant patients receiving care with limited English proficiency in Washington State (30.4% vs 7.6%). CONCLUSION: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate in pregnant people was 70% higher than similarly aged adults in Washington State, which could not be completely explained by universal screening at delivery. Pregnant patients from nearly all racial and ethnic minority groups and patients receiving medical care in a non-English language were overrepresented. Pregnant women were not protected from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in the early months of the pandemic. Moreover, the greatest burden of infections occurred in nearly all racial and ethnic minority groups. These data coupled with a broader recognition that pregnancy is a risk factor for severe illness and maternal mortality strongly suggested that pregnant people should be broadly prioritized for coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine allocation in the United States similar to some states.","Lokken, Erica M; Taylor, G Gray; Huebner, Emily M; Vanderhoeven, Jeroen; Hendrickson, Sarah; Coler, Brahm; Sheng, Jessica S; Walker, Christie L; McCartney, Stephen A; Kretzer, Nicole M; Resnick, Rebecca; Kachikis, Alisa; Barnhart, Nena; Schulte, Vera; Bergam, Brittany; Ma, Kimberly K; Albright, Catherine; Larios, Valerie; Kelley, Lori; Larios, Victoria; Emhoff, Sharilyn; Rah, Jasmine; Retzlaff, Kristin; Thomas, Chad; Paek, Bettina W; Hsu, Rita J; Erickson, Anne; Chang, Andrew; Mitchell, Timothy; Hwang, Joseph K; Gourley, Rebecca; Erickson, Stephen; Delaney, Shani; Kline, Carolyn R; Archabald, Karen; Blain, Michela; LaCourse, Sylvia M; Adams Waldorf, Kristina M",,MEDLINE,,20210324.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2021.02.011,covidwho-1144464,1097-6868,1,Am J Obstet Gynecol,en,US,2021.0,"Am J Obstet Gynecol;225(1): 75.e1-75.e16, 2021 Jul.

"IMPORTANCE: Blacks and Latinx are disproportionately affected by Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and experience higher mortality rates than Whites and Asians in the USA. Such racial disparities, in Covid-19 testing, cases, and mortality are visible in Connecticut too. Recently, excess deaths have become an important consideration in news reports and academic research. However, data on racial differences in excess death is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study examines racial/ethnic differences in excess deaths in the state of Connecticut during the Covid-19 pandemic. DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional epidemiological study to estimate excess deaths by racial/ethnic status utilizing mortality data during the peak months of Covid-19 infections from March 1 to June 30, 2020, in Connecticut. The following assumption is applied: expected non-Covid-19 deaths from March 1 to June 30, 2020, are equal to the number of deaths occurring during the period of March 1 to June 30, 2019. Race/ethnicity are defined as Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, and Latinx. Descriptive statistics and rates with 95% confidence intervals are presented. Chi-square analyses are performed where applicable. SETTING: Connecticut PARTICIPANTS: All deaths in Connecticut from March 1 to June 30, 2020. EXPOSURE: Covid-19 and race/ethnicity RESULTS: From March 1 to June 30, 2020, a total of 14,226 all-cause deaths occurred including 1514 Blacks (10.6%), 1095 Latinx (7.7%), and 11,617 Whites (81.7%). This represented a 74% increase in mortality for Blacks; 63% for Latinx, and 30% for Whites. In addition, 42.70% of the deaths in Blacks were attributed to Covid-19; 38.5% for Latinx, and 23.0% for Whites (p&lt;0.001). Covid-19 deaths accounted for over 90% of the excess deaths in Blacks and Hispanics. In contrast, in Whites, Covid-19 deaths exceeded the number of excess deaths by 353 cases (113.2%), indicating that some Whites may have died from other underlined health conditions with a positive Covid-19 diagnosis. Furthermore, there was an increase in undetermined deaths in 2020, which accounted for 10.8% of deaths in Blacks, 13% in Latinx, and 6.2% of deaths in Whites. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Excess deaths in Blacks and Latinx were found above the numbers of deaths determined to have occurred due to Covid-19. The fact that a large number of undetermined deaths were found for Blacks and Latinx individuals, and testing rates for Blacks and Latinx individuals (as determined by positivity rates) were lacking during this period strongly suggests, these excess deaths were Covid-19-related deaths. The study findings indicate that Black and Latinx COVID-19-related deaths may be underreported in this pandemic. We advocate for targeted strategies that increase testing capacity, treatment, and vaccine availability in Black and Latinx communities.","Laurencin, Cato T; Wu, Z Helen; McClinton, Aneesah; Grady, James J; Walker, Joanne M",,MEDLINE,African Americans/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; COVID-19/ethnology; COVID-19/mortality; Health Status Disparities; Hispanic Americans/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Connecticut/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; European Continental Ancestry Group/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Humans; Mortality/ethnology,20210324.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40615-021-01010-x,covidwho-1144425,2196-8837,3,J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,en,CH,2021.0,"J Racial Ethn Health Disparities;8(3): 783-789, 2021 06.

"Importance: Accumulating evidence suggests that children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are more likely to manifest mild symptoms and are at a lower risk of developing severe respiratory disease compared with adults. It remains unknown how the immune response in children differs from that of adolescents and adults. Objective: To investigate the association of age with the quantity and quality of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used 31a?¡¥426 SARS-CoV-2 antibody test results from pediatric and adult patients. Data were collected from a New York City hospital from April 9 to August 31, 2020. The semiquantitative immunoglobin (Ig) G levels were compared between 85 pediatric and 3648 adult patients. Further analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles was performed on sera from 126 patients aged 1 to 24 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rates and IgG levels were evaluated in patients from a wide range of age groups (1-102 years). SARS-CoV-2 IgG level, total antibody (TAb) level, surrogate neutralizing antibody (SNAb) activity, and antibody binding avidity were compared between children (aged 1-10 years), adolescents (aged 11-18 years), and young adults (aged 19-24 years). Results: Among 31a?¡¥426 antibody test results (19a?¡¥797 [63.0%] female patients), with 1194 pediatric patients (mean [SD] age, 11.0 [5.3] years) and 30a?¡¥232 adult patients (mean [SD] age, 49.2 [17.1] years), the seroprevalence in the pediatric (197 [16.5%; 95% CI, 14.4%-18.7%]) and adult (5630 [18.6%; 95% CI, 18.2%-19.1%]) patient populations was similar. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG level showed a negative correlation with age in the pediatric population (r = -0.45, P &lt; .001) and a moderate but positive correlation with age in adults (r = 0.24, P &lt; .001). Patients aged 19 to 30 years exhibited the lowest IgG levels (eg, aged 25-30 years vs 1-10 years: 99 [44-180] relative fluorescence units [RFU] vs 443 [188-851] RFU). In the subset cohort aged 1 to 24 years, IgG, TAb, SNAb and avidity were negatively correlated with age (eg, IgG: r = -0.51; P &lt; .001). Children exhibited higher median (IQR) IgG levels, TAb levels, and SNAb activity compared with adolescents (eg, IgG levels: 473 [233-656] RFU vs 191 [82-349] RFU; P &lt; .001) and young adults (eg, IgG levels: 473 [233-656] RFU vs 85 [38-150] RFU; P &lt; .001). Adolescents also exhibited higher median (IQR) TAb levels, IgG levels, and SNAb activity than young adults (eg, TAb levels: 961 [290-2074] RFU vs 370 [125-697]; P = .006). In addition, children had higher antibody binding avidity compared with young adults, but the difference was not significant. Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this study suggest that SARS-CoV-2 viral specific antibody response profiles are distinct in different age groups. Age-targeted strategies for disease screening and management as well as vaccine development may be warranted.","Yang, He S; Costa, Victoria; Racine-Brzostek, Sabrina E; Acker, Karen P; Yee, Jim; Chen, Zhengming; Karbaschi, Mohsen; Zuk, Robert; Rand, Sophie; Sukhu, Ashley; Klasse, P J; Cushing, Melissa M; Chadburn, Amy; Zhao, Zhen",,MEDLINE,"Antibodies, Neutralizing/blood; Antibodies, Viral/blood; Antibody Affinity/immunology; Antibody Formation/immunology; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Age Factors; COVID-19/diagnosis; COVID-19/epidemiology; COVID-19/immunology; COVID-19 Serological Testing/methods; COVID-19 Serological Testing/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Child; Correlation of Data; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin G/blood; Male; Middle Aged; New York City/epidemiology; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; SARS-CoV-2/isolation &amp;amp; purification",20210324.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.4302,covidwho-1144219,2574-3805,3,JAMA Netw Open,en,US,2021.0,"JAMA Netw Open;4(3): e214302, 2021 03 01.

"Introduction: The SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic has triggered the need to develop rapidly effective and safe vaccines to prevent infection, particularly in those at-risk populations such as medical personnel. This study&#039;s objective was to assess the perception of COVID-19 vaccination amongst Colombian physicians featuring two different scenarios of COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study was carried out through an online survey directed at medical staff in several cities in Colombia. The percentage of physicians who have a positive perception to be vaccinated and the associated factors that determine that decision were determined. A binomial regression analysis adjusted for age and sex was carried out, taking as a dependent variable the acceptance of free vaccination with an effectiveness of 60 and 80%. The most significant factors were determined in the non-acceptance of vaccination. Results: Between 77.0% and 90.7% of physicians in Colombia accept COVID-19 vaccination, according to the scenario evaluated where the vaccine&#039;s effectiveness was 60 or 80%, respectively. Medical specialty, having never paid for a vaccine, recommending the administration of the vaccine to their parents or people over 70 years, and dispensing the vaccine to their children, were the factors to consider to be vaccinated for free with an effectiveness of 60% and 80%. Conclusions: There is a high perception of the intention to vaccinate physicians in Colombia against COVID-19, and this is very similar to that of the general population.","Alvarado-Socarras, Jorge L; Vesga-Varela, Andrea Liliana; Quintero-Lesmes, Doris Cristina; Fama-Pereira, Marcela M; Serrano-Diaz, Norma C; Vasco, Mauricio; Carballo-Zarate, Virgil; Zambrano, Lysien I; Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J",,MEDLINE,,20210323.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9030287,covidwho-1143624,2076-393X,3,,en,CH,2021.0,Vaccines (Basel);9(3)2021 Mar 19. ,Perception of COVID-19 Vaccination Amongst Physicians in Colombia.,article,,,9

The study was performed within the EPICOVID19 web-based Italian survey, involving adults from April-June 2020. Out of 207,341 respondents, 95.9% completed the questionnaire (60% women with an average age of 47.3 vs. 48.9 years among men). The association between fear and demographic and SES characteristics, contacts with COVID-19 cases, nasopharyngeal swab, self-perceived health, flu vaccination, chronic diseases and specific symptoms was analyzed by logistic regression model; odds ratios adjusted for sex, age, education and occupation were calculated (aORs). Fear for FMs prevailed over fear for oneself and was higher among women than men. Fear for oneself decreased with higher levels of education and in those who perceived good health. Among those vaccinated for the flu, 40.8% responded they had feelings of fear for themselves vs. 34.2% of the not vaccinated. Fear increased when diseases were declared and it was higher when associated with symptoms such as chest pain, olfactory/taste disorders, heart palpitations (aORs &gt; 1.5), lung or kidney diseases, hypertension, depression and/or anxiety. Trends in fear by region showed the highest percentage of positive responses in the southern regions. The knowledge gained from these results should be used to produce tailored messages and shared public health decisions.","Cori, Liliana; Curzio, Olivia; Adorni, Fulvio; Prinelli, Federica; Noale, Marianna; Trevisan, Caterina; Fortunato, Loredana; Giacomelli, Andrea; Bianchi, Fabrizio",,MEDLINE,COVID-19; Pandemics; Adult; Anxiety; Cross-Sectional Studies; Family; Fear; Female; Humans; Internet; Italy/epidemiology; Male; Middle Aged; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires,20210323.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18063248,covidwho-1143508,1660-4601,6,Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),en,CH,2021.0,Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(6)2021 03 21. ,Fear of COVID-19 for Individuals and Family Members: Indications from the National Cross-Sectional Study of the EPICOVID19 Web-Based Survey.,article,,,18
"BACKGROUND: Vaccines for COVID-19 are currently available for the public in Israel. The compliance with vaccination has differed between sectors in Israel and the uptake has been substantially lower in the Arab compared with the Jewish population. AIM: To assess ethnic and socio-demographic factors in Israel associated with attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines prior to their introduction. METHODS: A national cross-sectional survey was carried out In Israel during October 2020 using an internet panel of around 100,000 people, supplemented by snowball sampling. A sample of 957 adults aged 30 and over were recruited of whom 606 were Jews (49% males) and 351 were Arabs (38% males). RESULTS: The sample of Arabs was younger than for the Jewish respondents. Among the men, 27.3% of the Jewish and 23.1% of the Arab respondents wanted to be vaccinated immediately, compared with only 13.6% of Jewish women and 12.0% of Arab women. An affirmative answer to the question as to whether they would refuse the vaccine at any stage was given by 7.7% of Jewish men and 29.9% of Arab men, and 17.2% of Jewish women and 41.0% of Arab women. Higher education was associated with less vaccine hesitancy. In multiple logistic regression analysis, the ethnic and gender differences persisted after controlling for age and education. Other factors associated with vaccine hesitancy were the belief that the government restrictions were too lenient and the frequency of socializing prior to the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed a relatively high percentage reported would be reluctant to get vaccinated, prior to the introduction of the vaccine. This was more marked so for Arabs then Jews, and more so for women within the ethnic groups. While this was not a true random sample, the findings are consistent with the large ethnic differences in compliance with the vaccine, currently encountered and reinforce the policy implications for developing effective communication to increase vaccine adherence. Government policies directed at controlling the pandemic should include sector-specific information campaigns, which are tailored to ensure community engagement, using targeted messages to the suspected vaccine hesitant groups. Government ministries, health service providers and local authorities should join hands with civil society organizations to promote vaccine promotion campaigns.","Green, Manfred S; Abdullah, Rania; Vered, Shiraz; Nitzan, Dorit",,MEDLINE,"Arabs/psychology; COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Jews/psychology; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Attitude to Health; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Israel/epidemiology; Male; Middle Aged; SARS-CoV-2; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors",20210323.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13584-021-00458-w,covidwho-1143260,2045-4015,1,Isr J Health Policy Res,en,GB,2021.0,"Isr J Health Policy Res;10(1): 26, 2021 03 19.

"BACKGROUND: Wuhan was the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. We aimed to determine the seroprevalence and kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at population level in Wuhan to inform the development of vaccination strategies. METHODS: In this longitudinal cross-sectional study, we used a multistage, population-stratified, cluster random sampling method to systematically select 100 communities from the 13 districts of Wuhan. Households were systematically selected from each community and all family members were invited to community health-care centres to participate. Eligible individuals were those who had lived in Wuhan for at least 14 days since Dec 1, 2019. All eligible participants who consented to participate completed a standardised electronic questionnaire of demographic and clinical questions and self-reported any symptoms associated with COVID-19 or previous diagnosis of COVID-19. A venous blood sample was taken for immunological testing on April 14-15, 2020. Blood samples were tested for the presence of pan-immunoglobulins, IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and neutralising antibodies were assessed. We did two successive follow-ups between June 11 and June 13, and between Oct 9 and Dec 5, 2020, at which blood samples were taken. FINDINGS: Of 4600 households randomly selected, 3599 families (78¡¤2%) with 9702 individuals attended the baseline visit. 9542 individuals from 3556 families had sufficient samples for analyses. 532 (5¡¤6%) of 9542 participants were positive for pan-immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2, with a baseline adjusted seroprevalence of 6¡¤92% (95% CI 6¡¤41-7¡¤43) in the population. 437 (82¡¤1%) of 532 participants who were positive for pan-immunoglobulins were asymptomatic. 69 (13¡¤0%) of 532 individuals were positive for IgM antibodies, 84 (15¡¤8%) were positive for IgA antibodies, 532 (100%) were positive for IgG antibodies, and 212 (39¡¤8%) were positive for neutralising antibodies at baseline. The proportion of individuals who were positive for pan-immunoglobulins who had neutralising antibodies in April remained stable for the two follow-up visits (162 [44¡¤6%] of 363 in June, 2020, and 187 [41¡¤2%] of 454 in October-December, 2020). On the basis of data from 335 individuals who attended all three follow-up visits and who were positive for pan-immunoglobulins, neutralising antibody levels did not significantly decrease over the study period (median 1/5¡¤6 [IQR 1/2¡¤0 to 1/14¡¤0] at baseline vs 1/5¡¤6 [1/4¡¤0 to 1/11¡¤2] at first follow-up [p=1¡¤0] and 1/6¡¤3 [1/2¡¤0 to 1/12¡¤6] at second follow-up [p=0¡¤29]). However, neutralising antibody titres were lower in asymptomatic individuals than in confirmed cases and symptomatic individuals. Although titres of IgG decreased over time, the proportion of individuals who had IgG antibodies did not decrease substantially (from 30 [100%] of 30 at baseline to 26 [89¡¤7%] of 29 at second follow-up among confirmed cases, 65 [100%] of 65 at baseline to 58 [92¡¤1%] of 63 at second follow-up among symptomatic individuals, and 437 [100%] of 437 at baseline to 329 [90¡¤9%] of 362 at second follow-up among asymptomatic individuals). INTERPRETATION: 6¡¤92% of a cross-sectional sample of the population of Wuhan developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with 39¡¤8% of this population seroconverting to have neutralising antibodies. Our durability data on humoral responses indicate that mass vaccination is needed to effect herd protection to prevent the resurgence of the epidemic.

In this competition, we predict international arrivals for 20 destinations in two phases: (i) Ex post forecasts pre-COVID;(ii) Ex ante forecasts during and after the pandemic up to end 2021. Our results show that univariate combined with cross-sectional hierarchical forecasting techniques (THieF-ETS) outperform multivariate models pre-COVID. Scenarios were developed based on judgemental adjustment of the THieF-ETS baseline forecasts. Analysts provided a regional view on the most likely path to normal, based on country-specific regulations, macroeconomic conditions, seasonal factors and vaccine development.

"BACKGROUND: Vaccines are one of the most important achievements of modern medicine. However, their acceptance is only partial, with vaccine hesitancy and refusal representing a major health threat. Influenza vaccines have low compliance since repeated, annual vaccination is required. Influenza vaccines stimulate discussions both in the real world and online. Social media is currently a significant source of health and medical information. Elucidating the association between social media engagement and influenza vaccination is important and may be applicable to other vaccines, including ones against COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to characterize profiles of social media engagement regarding the influenza vaccine and their association with knowledge and compliance in order to support improvement of future web-associated vaccination campaigns. METHODS: A weblink to an online survey in Hebrew was disseminated over social media and messaging platforms. The survey answers were collected during April 2020. Anonymous and volunteer participants aged 21 years and over answered 30 questions related to sociodemographics; social media usage; influenza- and vaccine-related knowledge and behavior; health-related information searching, its reliability, and its influence; and COVID-19-related information searching. A univariate descriptive data analysis was performed, followed by multivariate analysis via building a decision tree to define the most important attributes associated with vaccination compliance. RESULTS: A total of 213 subjects responded to the survey, of whom 207 were included in the analysis; the majority of the respondents were female, were aged 21 to 40 years, had 1 to 2 children, lived in central Israel, were secular Israeli natives, had higher education, and had a salary close to the national average. Most respondents (128/207, 61.8%) were not vaccinated against influenza in 2019 and used social media. Participants that used social media were younger, secular, and living in high-density agglomerations and had lower influenza vaccination rates. The perceived influence and reliability of the information on social media about COVID-19 were generally similar to those perceptions about influenza. CONCLUSIONS: Using social media is negatively linked to compliance with seasonal influenza vaccination in this study. A high proportion of noncompliant individuals can lead to increased consumption of health care services and can, therefore, overload these health services. This is particularly crucial with a concomitant outbreak, such as COVID-19. Health care professionals should use improved and targeted health communication campaigns with the aid of experts in social media. Targeted communication, based on sociodemographic factors and personalized social media usage, might increase influenza vaccination rates and compliance with other vaccines as well.","Benis, Arriel; Khodos, Anna; Ran, Sivan; Levner, Eugene; Ashkenazi, Shai",,MEDLINE,COVID-19/epidemiology; Influenza Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; Social Media/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Internet; Israel/epidemiology; Male; Pandemics; Reproducibility of Results; SARS-CoV-2/isolation &amp;amp; purification; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Young Adult,20210322.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/25977,covidwho-1140618,1438-8871,3,J Med Internet Res,en,CA,2021.0,"J Med Internet Res;23(3): e25977, 2021 03 16.

"Background: Understanding mid-term kinetics of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is the cornerstone for public health control of the pandemic and vaccine development. However, current evidence is rather based on limited measurements, losing sight of the temporal pattern of these changes. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal analysis on a prospective cohort of COVID-19 patients followed up for more than 6 months. Neutralizing activity was evaluated using HIV reporter pseudoviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein. IgG antibody titer was evaluated by ELISA against the S2 subunit, the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the nucleoprotein (NP). Statistical analyses were carried out using mixed-effects models. Findings: We found that individuals with mild or asymptomatic infection experienced an insignificant decay in neutralizing activity, which persisted six months after symptom onset or diagnosis. Hospitalized individuals showed higher neutralizing titers, which decreased following a two-phase pattern, with an initial rapid decline that significantly slowed after day 80. Despite this initial decay, neutralizing activity at six months remained higher among hospitalized individuals compared to mild symptomatic. The slow decline in neutralizing activity at mid-term contrasted with the steep slope of anti-RBD, S2 or NP antibody titers, all of them showing a constant decline over the follow-up period. Conclusions: Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the quality of the neutralizing immune response against SARS-CoV-2 evolves over the post-convalescent stage. Funding: This study was funded by Grifols, CERCA Programme and Departament de Salut (Generalitat de Catalunya), Spanish Health Institute Carlos III, and the crowdfunding initiatives #joemcorono, BonPreu/Esclat and Correos.","Pradenas, Edwards; Trinit¨¦, Benjamin; Urrea, V¨ªctor; Marfil, Silvia; ¨¢vila-Nieto, Carlos; Rodr¨ªguez de la Concepci¨®n, Mar¨ªa Luisa; Tarr¨¦s-Freixas, Ferran; P¨¦rez-Yanes, Silvia; Rovirosa, Carla; Ainsua-Enrich, Erola; Rodon, Jordi; Vergara-Alert, J¨²lia; Segal¨¦s, Joaquim; Guallar, Victor; Valencia, Alfonso; Izquierdo-Useros, Nuria; Paredes, Roger; Mateu, Lourdes; Chamorro, Anna; Massanella, Marta; Carrillo, Jorge; Clotet, Bonaventura; Blanco, Juli¨¤",,MEDLINE,,20210318.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.medj.2021.01.005,covidwho-1135490,2666-6340,,,en,US,2021.0,Med (N Y);2021 Jan 31. ,Stable neutralizing antibody levels six months after mild and severe COVID-19 episode.,article,,,
"Long-term immunological memory to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is crucial for the development of population-level immunity, which is the aim of vaccination approaches. Reports on rapidly decreasing antibody titers have led to questions regarding the efficacy of humoral immunity alone. The relevance of T cell memory after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear. Here, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 antibody and T cell responses in matched samples of COVID-19 convalescent individuals up to 6 months after infection. Longitudinal analysis revealed decreasing and stable spike- and nucleocapsid-specific antibody responses, respectively. In contrast, functional T cell responses remained robust, and even increased, in both frequency and intensity. Single peptide mapping of T cell diversity over time identified open reading frame-independent, dominant T cell epitopes mediating long-term SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses. Identification of these epitopes may be fundamental for COVID-19 vaccine design.","Bilich, Tatjana; Nelde, Annika; Heitmann, Jonas S; Maringer, Yacine; Roerden, Malte; Bauer, Jens; Rieth, Jonas; Wacker, Marcel; Peter, Andreas; H?rber, Sebastian; Rachfalski, David; M?rklin, Melanie; Stevanovic, Stefan; Rammensee, Hans-Georg; Salih, Helmut R; Walz, Juliane S",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/immunology; Immunologic Memory; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; T-Lymphocytes/immunology; Antibodies, Viral/blood; Antibodies, Viral/immunology; Convalescence; Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Proteins/immunology; Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology; Humans; Immunodominant Epitopes/immunology; Kinetics; Peptide Mapping; Phosphoproteins/immunology; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus/immunology",20210318.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abf7517,covidwho-1136061,1946-6242,590,Sci. transl. med,en,US,2021.0,Sci Transl Med;13(590)2021 04 21. ,T cell and antibody kinetics delineate SARS-CoV-2 peptides mediating long-term immune responses in COVID-19 convalescent individuals.,article,,,13
"Vaccines constitute highly effective tools for controlling and eliminating vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) and are assessed to avert between two to three million deaths per year globally. Healthcare personnel (HCP) constitute a priority group for several vaccinations. However, studies indicate significant rates of vaccine hesitancy among them and, therefore, of acceptance of vaccination recommendations. This cross-sectional study was conducted in a university hospital in Southern Italy to assess the knowledge and attitudes of HCP about VPDs before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, estimate their intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and search for determinants that may influence their choice. A self-administered questionnaire was used. HCP improved their knowledge about VPDs and were more favorable to vaccinations in September-December 2020 compared to January-December 2019. Overall, 75% of respondents would get a COVID-19 vaccine.

"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 has brought about tests from many manufacturers. While molecular and rapid antigen tests are targeted for early diagnosis, immunoassays have a larger role in epidemiological studies, understanding longitudinal immunity, and in vaccine development and response. METHODS: The performance of the LIAISON? SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay was evaluated against the Beckman ACCESS SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay in New Mexico, and against the Siemens ADVIA Centaur COV2G assay in New York. Discordant samples were parsed using a microneutralization assay. RESULTS: A SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rate of 23.8% was observed in the samples tested in New York (September 2020), while in the same month the positivity rate was 1.5% in New Mexico. Positive and negative agreement were 67.6% (95% CI 49.5-82.6%) and 99.8% (95% CI 99.5-99.9%), respectively, with the Beckman test, and 98.0% (95% CI 95.7-99.3%) and 94.8% (95% CI 93.4-96.0%), respectively, with the Siemens test. Receiver operating characteristic analysis for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies discloses an AUC, area under the curve, of 0.996 (95% CI 0.992-0.999) for the LIAISON? SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay. The criterion associated to the Youden Index was determined to be &gt;12.9 kAU/L with a sensitivity of 99.44% and a specificity of 99.82%. CONCLUSIONS: The LIAISON? SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay is highly sensitive and specific. The balance of these parameters, without emphasis on high specificity alone, is particularly important when applied to high prevalence populations, where a highly sensitive assay will result in reporting a lower number of false negative subjects.","Bonelli, Fabrizio; Blocki, Frank A; Bunnell, Tina; Chu, Edward; De La O, Arriel; Grenache, David G; Marzucchi, Ginevra; Montomoli, Emanuele; Okoye, Lilian; Pallavicini, Luca; Streva, Vincent A; Torelli, Alessandro; Wagner, Aaron; Zanin, Davide; Zierold, Claudia; Wassenberg, James J",,MEDLINE,,20210317.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2021-0023,covidwho-1133703,1437-4331,8,Clin Chem Lab Med,en,DE,2021.0,"Clin Chem Lab Med;59(8): 1463-1467, 2021 07 27.

"The novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with an increasing public health concern. Due to the non-availability of a vaccine against the disease, non-pharmaceutical interventions constitute major preventive and control measures. However, inadequate knowledge about the disease and poor perception might limit compliance. This study examined COVID-19-related knowledge, practices, perceptions and associated factors amongst undergraduate veterinary medical students in Nigeria. A cross-sectional web survey was employed to collect data from 437 consenting respondents using pre-tested self-administered questionnaire (August 2020). Demographic factors associated with the knowledge and adoption of recommended preventive practices towards COVID-19 were explored using multivariate logistic regression at P &amp;#8804; 0.05. The respondents&#039; mean knowledge and practice scores were 22.7 (SD ¡À 3.0) and 24.1 (SD ¡À 2.9), respectively with overall 63.4% and 88.8% displaying good knowledge and satisfactory practice levels. However, relatively lower proportions showed adherence to avoid touching face or nose (19.5%), face mask-wearing (58.1%), and social distancing (57.4%).

"INTRODUCTION: In the context of a highly contagious virus with only recently approved vaccines and no cure, the key to slowing the spread of the COVID-19 disease and successfully transitioning through the phases of the pandemic, including vaccine uptake, is public adherence to rapidly evolving behaviour-based public health policies. The overall objective of the iCARE Study is to assess public awareness, attitudes, concerns and behavioural responses to COVID-19 public health policies, and their impacts, on people around the world and to link behavioural survey data with policy, mobility and case data to provide behavioural science, data-driven recommendations to governments on how to optimise current policy strategies to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSES: The iCARE study (www.icarestudy.com) uses a multiple cross-sectional survey design to capture self-reported information on a variety of COVID-19 related variables from individuals around the globe. Survey data are captured using two data capture methods: convenience and representative sampling. These data are then linked to open access data for policies, cases and population movement. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The primary ethical approval was obtained from the coordinating site, the Centre int¨¦gr¨¦ universitaire de sant¨¦ et de services sociaux du Nord-de-l&#039;?le-de-Montr¨¦al (REB#: 2020-2099/03-25-2020). This study will provide high-quality, accelerated and real-time evidence to help us understand the effectiveness of evolving country-level policies and communication strategies to reduce the spread of the COVID-19. Due to the urgency of the pandemic, results will be disseminated in a variety of ways, including policy briefs, social media posts, press releases and through regular scientific methods.","Bacon, Simon L; Lavoie, Kim L; Boyle, Jacqueline; Stojanovic, Jovana; Joyal-Desmarais, Keven",,MEDLINE,Attitude; COVID-19/psychology; Health Policy; Quality of Life; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Pandemics; Public Health; Surveys and Questionnaires,20210317.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046127,covidwho-1133215,2044-6055,3,BMJ Open,en,GB,2021.0,"BMJ Open;11(3): e046127, 2021 03 11.

"PURPOSE: To examine the vaccine-related beliefs and behaviors associated with likely hesitancy toward vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among nonelderly adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in June 2020. Responses were sought from Tennessee adults 18 to 64 years of age who were not healthcare providers. The survey instrument focused on vaccine-related beliefs, prior and planned influenza and pneumococcal vaccine use, and attitudes toward receiving a COVID-19 vaccination. Inferential statistics assessed survey responses, and logistic regression determined predictors of the likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 1,000 completed responses were analyzed (a 62.9% response rate), and respondents were mostly White (80.1%), insured (79.6%), and/or actively working (64.2%); the sample was well balanced by gender, age, income, and political leaning. Approximately one-third (34.4%) of respondents indicated some historical vaccine hesitancy, and only 21.4% indicated always getting a seasonal influenza vaccination. More than half (54.1%) indicated at least some hesitancy toward vaccination against COVID-19, with 32.1% citing lack of evidence of vaccine effectiveness as the leading reason. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was more likely among those with more moderate (odds ratio [OR], 2.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.749-3.607) or conservative (OR, 3.01; 95% CI, 2.048-4.421) political leanings, Black Americans (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.182-2.742), and residents of nonmetropolitan areas (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.386-2.865). CONCLUSION: Subgroups of the population may prove more challenging to vaccinate against COVID-19, requiring targeted approaches to addressing hesitancy to ensure more-vulnerable populations are adequately covered.","Gatwood, Justin; McKnight, Madison; Fiscus, Michelle; Hohmeier, Kenneth C; Chisholm-Burns, Marie",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19 Vaccines; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Vaccination/methods; Adolescent; Adult; African Americans; Age Factors; Attitude; Cross-Sectional Studies; Culture; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; Male; Middle Aged; Pneumococcal Vaccines; Politics; Rural Population; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Tennessee; Young Adult",20210317.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab099,covidwho-1132429,1535-2900,10,Am J Health Syst Pharm,en,GB,2021.0,"Am J Health Syst Pharm;78(10): 879-889, 2021 05 06.

"Background: Disturbances are occurring in healthcare, trade, and travel, with countries closing off their borders due to the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) in the world. The pandemic has its impact on the delivery of important health services, including vaccinations. This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on vaccination coverage among children aged 15-23?months.Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from July 22 to August 7, 2020, in Dessie town, Ethiopia. 633 children with their mother/caregiver were interviewed. Interviewer administered pre-tested structured questioner was used. Data was entered into EPI data and analyzed by using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences). Both binary and multivariate logistic regression analyses were tested. In multivariate analysis, a significant association was declared at a p-value of &lt; 0.05.Result: Response rate was 96.4%. Based on the vaccination card plus recall, 350 (57.4%) of children finished all recommended vaccines. Age-eligible vaccination coverage during the COVID-19 outbreak was 12.5% lower than before the outbreak. Being a father main caregiver, mother/caregiver who can write and read, and mother/caregiver who educated from grade 1 to 8 mother/caregiver who is divorced, mother/caregiver who spend more than 30?minutes to reach health institution, and mother/caregiver who aware about the benefit of vaccination, about the campaign, and knowledge of COVID-19 each shows statistically significant association with full vaccination status of children.Conclusion: Full vaccination coverage among children aged 15-23?months remains low in Dessie town, which further decreases after the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Healthcare workers are particularly exposed to biological risk during their daily occupational activities. Nowadays, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become one of the most widespread infectious agents. In the current study, we performed a survey on the attitude and behavior of Polish healthcare workers (HCW), which comprise physicians (MD) and administrative healthcare assistants (HA) towards the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. Our study involved 2300 subjects (42.17% female; 10.96% MD; 5.87% HA). The evaluation was conducted using a Google Forms survey based on original questions and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items questionnaire. HCW significantly more often demonstrated their willingness to get vaccinated against the SARS-CoV-2 as compared to the control group (82.95% vs. 54.31%, respectively). The main concern, as regards all groups, was the development of long-term side effects after getting COVID-19 vaccine. The study revealed that depression significantly affects the willingness to get vaccinated. The readiness was significantly strengthened by positive medical history of recommended vaccinations, fear of catching COVID-19, as well as fear of passing on the disease to the relatives. Overall, the percentage of HCW, who want to be vaccinated against COVID-19 remains unsatisfactory. Further works exploring this subject are needed to take a step closer to achieving the herd immunity in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Szmyd, Bartosz; Karuga, Filip Franciszek; Bartoszek, Adrian; Staniecka, Katarzyna; Siwecka, Natalia; Bartoszek, Agnieszka; Blaszczyk, Maciej; Radek, Maciej",,MEDLINE,,20210316.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9030218,covidwho-1129792,2076-393X,3,,en,CH,2021.0,Vaccines (Basel);9(3)2021 Mar 04. ,Attitude and Behaviors towards SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination among Healthcare Workers: A Cross-Sectional Study from Poland.,article,,,9
"With the demand for rapid COVID-19 vaccine development and evaluation, this paper aimed to describe the prevalence and correlates of willingness to participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials among university students in China. A cross-sectional survey with 1,912 Chinese university students was conducted during March and April 2020. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify variables associated with willingness to participate. The majority of participants (64.01%) indicated willingness to participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Hesitancy over signing informed consent documents, concerns over time necessary for participating in a medical study, and perceived COVID-19 societal stigma were identified as deterrents, whereas lower socioeconomic status, female gender, perception of likely COVID-19 infection during the pandemic, and COVID-19 prosocial behaviors were facilitative factors. Further, public health mistrust and hesitancy over signing informed consent documents had a significant interactive effect on vaccine trial willingness. High standards of ethical and scientific practice are needed in COVID-19 vaccine research, including providing potential participants full and accurate information and ensuring participation free of coercion, socioeconomic inequality, and stigma. Attending to the needs of marginalized groups and addressing psychosocial factors including stigma and public health mistrust may also be important to COVID-19 vaccine development and future uptake.","Sun, Shufang, Lin, Danhua, Operario, Don",,ScienceDirect,,20210316.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2021.101350,covidwho-1129140,,,Preventive Medicine Reports,en,,2021.0,"Preventive Medicine Reports;: 101350, 2021.","Interest in COVID-19 vaccine trials participation among young adults in China: Willingness, reasons for hesitancy, and demographic and psychosocial determinants",article,,,
"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccines will become available in China soon. Understanding communities&#039; responses to the forthcoming COVID-19 vaccines is important. We applied the theory of planned behavior as the theoretical framework. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the prevalence of and factors associated with behavioral intention to receive self-financed or free COVID-19 vaccinations among Chinese factory workers who resumed work during the pandemic. We examined the effects of factors including sociodemographics, perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination, exposure to information about COVID-19 vaccination through social media, and COVID-19 preventive measures implemented by individuals and factories. METHODS: Participants were full-time employees 18 years or older who worked in factories in Shenzhen. Factory workers in Shenzhen are required to receive a physical examination annually. Eligible workers attending six physical examination sites were invited to complete a survey on September 1-7, 2020. Out of 2653 eligible factory workers, 2053 (77.4%) completed the online survey. Multivariate two-level logistic regression models and ordinal logistic regression models were fitted. RESULTS: The prevalence of behavioral intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination was 66.6% (n=1368, conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and market rate) and 80.6% (n=1655, conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and free vaccines). After adjusting for significant background characteristics, positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.20, 95% CI 1.15-1.25 and AOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.19-1.30), perceived support from significant others for getting a COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.32-1.55 and AOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.25-1.50), and perceived behavioral control to get a COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.32-1.73 and AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.51) were positively associated with both dependent variables (conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and market rate or free vaccines, respectively). Regarding social media influence, higher frequency of exposure to positive information related to COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a higher intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination at market rate (AOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.39-1.70) or a free vaccination (AOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.35-1.71). Higher self-reported compliance with wearing a face mask in the workplace (AOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02-1.58 and AOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.24-2.27) and other public spaces (AOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.42-2.29 and AOR 1.34, 95% CI 1.01-1.77), hand hygiene (AOR 1.21, 95% CI 1.00-1.47 and AOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.19-1.93), and avoiding social gatherings (AOR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.47 and AOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.23-1.95) and crowded places (AOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02-1.51 and AOR 1.73, 95% CI 1.37-2.18) were also positively associated with both dependent variables. The number of COVID-19 preventive measures implemented by the factory was positively associated with the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination under both scenarios (AOR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.12 and AOR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.11). CONCLUSIONS: Factory workers in China reported a high behavioral intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. The theory of planned behavior is a useful framework to guide the development of future campaigns promoting COVID-19 vaccination.","Zhang, Ke Chun; Fang, Yuan; Cao, He; Chen, Hongbiao; Hu, Tian; Chen, Yaqi; Zhou, Xiaofeng; Wang, Zixin",,MEDLINE,COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Immunization Programs/methods; Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19/epidemiology; China/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Intention; Internet; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2/isolation &amp;amp; purification; Surveys and Questionnaires; Workplace; Young Adult,20210315.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/24673,covidwho-1127915,1438-8871,3,J Med Internet Res,en,CA,2021.0,"J Med Internet Res;23(3): e24673, 2021 03 09.

"Vaccine hesitancy could undermine efforts to control COVID-19. We investigated the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the UK and identified vaccine hesitant subgroups. The &#039;Understanding Society&#039; COVID-19 survey asked participants (n?=?12,035) their likelihood of vaccine uptake and reason for hesitancy. Cross-sectional analysis assessed vaccine hesitancy prevalence and logistic regression calculated odds ratios. Overall vaccine hesitancy was low (18% unlikely/very unlikely). Vaccine hesitancy was higher in women (21.0% vs 14.7%), younger age groups (26.5% in 16-24?year olds vs 4.5% in 75?+?) and those with lower education levels (18.6% no qualifications vs 13.2% degree qualified). Vaccine hesitancy was high in Black (71.8%) and Pakistani/Bangladeshi (42.3%) ethnic groups. Odds ratios for vaccine hesitancy were 13.42 (95% CI:6.86, 26.24) in Black and 2.54 (95% CI:1.19, 5.44) in Pakistani/Bangladeshi groups (compared to White British/Irish) and 3.54 (95% CI:2.06, 6.09) for people with no qualifications versus degree.

"Background: In February 2020, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), was classified as a pandemic. In the pediatric population, coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 has a reported mortality of less than 6% in complicated cases; however, the clinical characteristics and severity are not the same as those presented in the adult population. This study aimed to describe the clinical manifestations of patients younger than 18 years old and their association with the confirmation of the test and outcomes. Methods: We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study of symptoms suggestive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. All subjects with a confirmatory test for SARS-CoV-2 were included. Initial symptoms, history of influenza vaccination, and previous contact were documented, and mortality and the requirement for assisted mechanical ventilation were identified. The proportions of the variables were compared with the &amp;#967;2 test. The odds ratio for a positive test and the requirement of intubation was calculated. Results: Of a total of 510 subjects, 76 (15%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The associated symptoms were chest pain, sudden onset of symptoms, and general malaise. The variable most associated with contagion was the exposure to a relative with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Infants and subjects without the influenza vaccine showed an increased risk for respiratory complications. Conclusions: The frequency of positivity in the test was 15% (infants and adolescents represented 64% of the confirmed cases), and the associated factors identified were contact with a confirmed case, sudden onset of symptoms, and chest pain.","Olivar-L¨®pez, V¨ªctor; Leyva-Barrera, Ana; L¨®pez-Mart¨ªnez, Briceida; Parra-Ortega, Israel; M¨¢rquez-Gonz¨¢lez, Horacio",,MEDLINE,"Betacoronavirus/isolation &amp;amp; purification; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Adolescent; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; Chest Pain/etiology; Child; Child, Preschool; Coronavirus Infections/complications; Coronavirus Infections/diagnosis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral/complications; Pneumonia, Viral/diagnosis; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2",20210315.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.24875/BMHIM.20000198,covidwho-1128309,1665-1146,5,Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,en,MX,2020.0,"Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex;77(5): 221-227, 2020.

"To control the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), COVID-19 vaccination has been quickly developed. However, the COVID-19 pandemic will not be controlled if the COVID-19 vaccination uptake willingness is low. Therefore, the study aim was to explore the COVID-19 vaccination uptake willingness among the outpatient population and healthcare workers in Taiwan during the worldwide pandemic period without community outbreaks. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among healthcare workers (HCWs;n = 500;mean age = 32.96 years) of National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH) and outpatients (n = 238;mean age = 34.43 years) arriving at NCKUH. We used an online survey conducted between September 24 and 21 November 2020, for healthcare workers, and between 27 October and 31 December 2020, for the outpatient sample. Information regarding willingness to receive vaccination, willingness to rapid test, fear of COVID-19, risk perception, and preventive behaviors was collected in both samples;information regarding willingness to care for patients was collected in healthcare workers. Willingness to receive vaccination was the main variable in the present study;willingness to rapid test, willingness to care for patients, fear of COVID-19, risk perception, and preventive behaviors were the secondary variables in the study. The factors associated with vaccination willingness were identified through logistic regression analysis. The participants¡¯ willingness to receive vaccination was low for both healthcare workers (23.4%) and the outpatient sample (30.7%). Similarly, their willingness to take rapid tests was low (23.6% for healthcare workers and 28.6% for outpatient sample). Risk perception (crude odds ratio (COR) = 1.29;95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03, 1.63), willingness to take rapid test (COR = 9.24;95% CI = 5.76, 14.83), and preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors (COR = 2.32;95% CI = 1.52, 3.56) were significant factors explaining the healthcare workers¡¯ willingness to receive vaccination. Willingness to take a rapid test (COR = 8.91;95% CI = 4.71, 16.87) and preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors (COR = 1.69;95% CI = 1.09, 2.60) were significant factors explaining the outpatient sample¡¯s willingness to receive vaccination. Willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 among HCWs and outpatients is low due to the relatively safe status of COVID-19 infection in Taiwan. These findings can help policymakers advocate for the effectiveness of and provide transparent information on COVID-19 vaccination uptake in a country/region with a relatively safe COVID-19 outbreak status.","Kukreti, Shikha, Lu, Mei-Yun, Lin, Yi-Hsuan, Strong, Carol, Lin, Chung-Ying, Ko, Nai-Ying, Chen, Po-Lin, Ko, Wen-Chien",,MDPI,,20210315.0,,covidwho-1126022,,3,Vaccines,en,,2021.0,"Vaccines; 9(3):246, 2021.",Willingness of Taiwan¡¯s Healthcare Workers and Outpatients to Vaccinate against COVID-19 during a Period without Community Outbreaks,article,,,9
"Vaccination could be a key protective measure against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and it is important to understand the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine among the general public. However, there is no study on the acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine in Japan. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy situation in Japan and assess the factors associated with such issues. This was a cross-sectional study based on an internet survey completed by 2956 people. Participants were asked to indicate how likely they were to get vaccinated for COVID-19. In addition, the participants responded to questions regarding sociodemographic factors, attitudes, and beliefs regarding COVID-19 infection and vaccination. The proportion of participants with a high likelihood of getting a COVID-19 vaccine was 62.1%. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that vaccine acceptance was lower among several sociodemographic groups, such as women, adults aged 20-49 years, and those with a low-income level. Several psychological factors, especially the perceived effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine, and willingness to protect others by getting oneself vaccinated, were associated with vaccine acceptance. Our results indicate that the perceived effectiveness of the vaccine and willingness to protect others may play an important role in the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine.","Machida, Masaki; Nakamura, Itaru; Kojima, Takako; Saito, Reiko; Nakaya, Tomoki; Hanibuchi, Tomoya; Takamiya, Tomoko; Odagiri, Yuko; Fukushima, Noritoshi; Kikuchi, Hiroyuki; Amagasa, Shiho; Watanabe, Hidehiro; Inoue, Shigeru",,MEDLINE,,20210312.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9030210,covidwho-1125918,2076-393X,3,,en,CH,2021.0,Vaccines (Basel);9(3)2021 Mar 03. ,Acceptance of a COVID-19 Vaccine in Japan during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,article,,,9
"Sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations are particularly vulnerable to poor COVID-19 outcomes and are more likely to experience stigma and medical mistrust that may impact COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. This study examined the prevalence of COVID testing and diagnosis and assessed COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among a large sample of SGM. Participants were recruited as part of an online cross-sectional study focused on an HIV biomedical prevention technology willingness in the United States at increased risk for HIV sero-conversion. Multivariate linear analysis was conducted to examine COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. The study sample included 1350 predominately gay (61.6%), Black (57.9%), cis-gender (95.7%) males with a mean age of 32.9 years. Medical mistrust and social concern regarding COVID-19 vaccine stigma were significantly associated with decreased COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, and altruism was significantly associated with increased vaccine acceptance. Black participants were significantly less likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine, and Asian participants were significantly more likely to accept a vaccine, compared to White peers. As the planning of COVID-19 vaccine rollout efforts is conceptualized and designed, these data may inform equitable implementation strategies and prevent worsening health inequities among SGM populations.","Teixeira da Silva, Daniel; Biello, Katie; Lin, Willey Y; Valente, Pablo K; Mayer, Kenneth H; Hightow-Weidman, Lisa; Bauermeister, Jos¨¦ A",,MEDLINE,,20210312.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9030204,covidwho-1125498,2076-393X,3,,en,CH,2021.0,Vaccines (Basel);9(3)2021 Mar 01. ,COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance among an Online Sample of Sexual and Gender Minority Men and Transgender Women.,article,,,9
"BACKGROUND: Elderly population is considered at high risk for pneumococcal diseases. The pneumococcal vaccine coverage presents extremely low among elderly people in China. However, the serious event of COVID-19 drives interest in the pneumococcal vaccine, prompting us investigating the willingness to accept the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) and influencing factors among people aged over 60 years during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was employed using a self-administered questionnaire in Shenzhen City of China, elaborating the willingness toward PPSV23 in the elderly persons. Binomial logistic analyses were performed to estimate the influencing factors using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Among 15,066 respondents, 91.5% presented a positive attitude toward PPSV23. Logistic analyses suggested the influencing factors included knowledge about pneumonia (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.391, 95%CI 1.214-1.593), perception of the seriousness of pneumonia (aOR 1.437, 95%CI 1.230-1.680) and preventing way for pneumonia (aOR 1.639, 95%CI 1.440-1.865), worried about getting pneumonia (aOR 2.751, 95%CI 2.444-3.096), understanding vaccine policy (aOR 1.774, 95%CI 1.514-2.079), and influenza vaccine (aOR 3.516 and 95%CI 2.261-5.468) and PPSV23 histories (aOR 3.199, 95%CI 1.492-6.860).

"Background and aims: Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) has classified the workplaces into 4 categories in terms of potential of disease: very high risk, high risk, intermediate risk and low risk. Jobs classification include: 1. Very high exposure risk jobs are those with very high potential to meet the discovered cases or suspected of Covid-19 disease during medical cares, after death or during clinical experiments like healthcare stuff and laboratories stuff. 2- High exposure risk jobs: jobs with high potential and lower than previous class jobs to meet the discovered cases or suspected of Covid-19 disease like healthcare and support services employees, medical transportation and funeral workers. 3. Medium exposure risk jobs: jobs where workers are in repeated contact with other workers, public or in close contact with people those possibly with Covid-19 disease but are not diagnosed as suspected ill. These jobs include schools, some crowded retails and activities with high population density. 4. Low exposure risk jobs: jobs where workers are not in close and continuous contact with other works, public or people suspected of Covid-19 disease. The work international organization announced people who are affected to Covid-19 in the workplace must have access to healthcare and treatment services including usual medical cares, specialized cares(inside and outside of the hospital) pharmaceutical, hospital and medical rehabilitation services. On the other hand, since no vaccine or certain treatment is known for this disease till now, the best way to prevent and decrease this disease is to raise the awareness and information about this virus, how this disease is created and how it spreads.so, the present study was conducted with the aim of determining the hygienic performance and effect of training in order to confronting with the Covid-19 virus in the metal industries staff Methods: This analytical-descriptive study is cross-sectional in terms of time. 5 metal industries were studied by the census method in Isfahan province (3 industries) and Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province (2 industries). The studied units include employers and directors, administrative, production, Facilities (Technical) and services stuff. To collect data, researcher-made checklist was used to evaluate the personal hygienic of stuff and to evaluate the industry environment and building, environment checklist was used. Totally 569 stuff and 11 checklists were studied to consider environmental health status in the studied industries buildings. Research team was composed of 2 experts. One expert was required to study the personal health of stuff and buildings environments hygiene and the other was responsible to teach stuff. The education subjects included properties of Covid-19 virus, symptoms of affecting to disease, disease transmission methods, methods of preventing the spread of the disease and importance to observe the personal health and the correct method to use the mask and gloves.

"After the March-April 2020 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, a second contagion wave afflicted Europe in the autumn. The present study aimed to evaluate sleep health/patterns of Italians during this further challenging situation. A total of 2,013 Italians longitudinally participated in a web-based survey during the two contagion peaks of the COVID-19 outbreak. We investigated the risk factors for sleep disturbances during the second wave, and we compared sleep quality and psychological well-being between the two assessments (March-April and November-December 2020). Female gender, low education, evening chronotype, being a high-risk person for COVID-19 infection, reporting negative social or economic impact, and evening smartphone overuse predicted a higher risk of poor sleep and insomnia symptoms during the second wave. Advanced age, living with a high-risk person for COVID-19 infection, and having a relative/friend infected with COVID-19 before the prior 2?weeks were risk categories for poor sleep quality. Living with children, having contracted COVID-19 before the prior 2?weeks, being pessimistic about the vaccine and working in healthcare, were risk factors for insomnia symptoms. The follow-up assessment highlighted reduced insomnia symptoms and anxiety. Nevertheless, we found reduced sleep duration, higher daytime dysfunction, advanced bedtime and wake-up time, and a shift to morningness, confirming the alarming prevalence of poor sleepers (~60%) and severe depression (~20%) in a context of increased perceived stress. The present study showed a persistent impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep and mental health.

"We aimed to assess the attitude towards influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccinations among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recovered patients. We performed a cross-sectional study consisting of a standardized telephone interview carried out between September and November 2020 targeting a cohort of adult in- and out-patients that had recovered from COVID-19 after the first wave (March-May 2020) at Udine Hospital (Italy). Overall, 599 people participated (320 female, median age 53 years) and most had experienced an acute COVID-19 with mild illness (409, 68.3%). The majority were hesitant or undecided towards influenza (327, 54.6%) and SARS-CoV-2 (353, 59.2%) vaccines. Older age, public work exposure, and previous 2019 flu shots were the main factors associated with a positive attitude toward both vaccinations (p &lt; 0.05).

"(1) Background: This study aims to delineate a pattern on vaccine hesitancy in a sample of the Spanish population, considering age groups and status as healthcare workers. (2) Methods: Participants were recruited using Twitter? as a dissemination tool to reach as many respondents as possible in different parts of the Spanish territory. The participants were recruited in a cross-sectional study, which included answering an online questionnaire. Data were collected from 10 September through 23 November 2020. Respondents answered questions asking whether they intended to be vaccinated and provided the main reason for their answers. To estimate associations between vaccination hesitancy and independent variables, we fit Poisson regression models with robust variance. (3) Results: One thousand and two responses were obtained, of which only 731 were validated. One hundred and sixty-four participants stated that they would not be vaccinated (22.43%), of which 20-24% were non-health workers or unemployed, 17.5% physicians, 31.5% other health workers, and almost 35% nurses. Concerns about lack of effectiveness of the vaccination, lack of safety when vaccinating and possibly dangerous adverse effects were the main causes provided. (4) Conclusions: This study indicates that more interventions are needed to achieve better communication with the population and health professionals.

"COVID-19 vaccines have been conditionally used in a few countries, including China since December 2020. The present study aimed to examine whether the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination changed in different COVID-19 epidemic phases in China. Two consecutive surveys were conducted among Chinese adults in March (n = 2058) (severe epidemic phase) and November-December (n = 2013) (well-contained phase, right before the COVID-19 vaccine was conditionally approved) 2020, and 791 respondents were longitudinally followed-up. The attitude, acceptance, and preferences for future COVID-19 vaccination were compared between two epidemic phases. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify influencing factors of acceptance. Among the 791 respondents longitudinally followed, 91.9% in March and 88.6% of them in November-December 2020 would like to get COVID-19 vaccination in China. In March 58.3% wished to get vaccinated immediately, but the proportion declined to 23.0% in November-December 2020, because more respondents wanted to delay vaccination until the vaccine&#039;s safety was confirmed. Similar results were found by comparing all respondents from the two cross-sectional surveys in different epidemic phases. The risk perception, attitude for the importance of vaccination against COVID-19, vaccination history, valuing doctor&#039;s recommendations, vaccination convenience, or vaccine price in decision-making had impacts on respondents&#039; intention for immediate vaccination. The public acceptance for COVID-19 vaccination in China sustained at a high level in different COVID-19 epidemic phases. However, the intention of immediate vaccination declined substantially due to concerns about the vaccine&#039;s safety. Information about vaccination safety from authoritative sources, doctor&#039;s recommendations, and vaccination convenience were important in addressing vaccine hesitancy and promoting successful herd immunity for the general population in China.","Wang, Jiahao; Lu, Xinran; Lai, Xiaozhen; Lyu, Yun; Zhang, Haijun; Fenghuang, Yufei; Jing, Rize; Li, Li; Yu, Wenzhou; Fang, Hai",,MEDLINE,,20210310.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9030191,covidwho-1120269,2076-393X,3,,en,CH,2021.0,Vaccines (Basel);9(3)2021 Feb 25. ,The Changing Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccination in Different Epidemic Phases in China: A Longitudinal Study.,article,,,9
"Health Care Workers are at the front line of the fight against Covid-19. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptability of vaccination against COVID-19 among health professionals (physicians, dentists, pharmacists) two weeks prior to the start of the Greek vaccination campaign against COVID-19. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted over the period 15-22 December 2020 in 340 health professionals in Central Greece. We found a high level of acceptance for COVID-19 vaccine (78.5%) and a high vaccination coverage for the influenza vaccine (74%).

Our study indicates a high level of the COVID-19 vaccination acceptance among physicians, dentists and pharmacists. Nevertheless, several interventions can be implemented to increase acceptance of vaccine among health-care workers (HCWs) and could be especially directed at younger and vaccine-hesitant health care workers due to fear of vaccine side-effects.

"OBJECTIVES: Increased exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a result of having an essential job is compounded by factors such as age, race, and ethnicity. We used a cross-sectional study design to describe disparities in the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) test results by demographic characteristics and clinical roles among a cohort of health care workers employed by the largest Midwestern health care system in the United States. METHODS: We collected 16 233 SARS-CoV-2 IgG serum samples from June 8 through July 10, 2020, from a convenience sample of Illinois- and Wisconsin-based adult health care workers. The research team, in collaboration with ACL Laboratories, used a SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Study data included SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay results and demographic characteristics of workers (age, sex, race, ethnicity, clinical role, zip code). We generated crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) to describe disparities in seroprevalence distribution among demographic and social factors. RESULTS: Of 16 233 IgG serum samples tested, 622 (3.8%) test results were positive for SARS-CoV-2. We found significant disparities in SARS-CoV-2 positivity by age, race, ethnicity, and clinical role. Participants aged 32-82 had lower adjusted ORs (aORs) of positive IgG than participants aged 18-31 (aOR range, 0.54-0.66). Odds of positivity were higher among Black (aOR = 3.86), Asian (aOR = 1.42), and mixed-race (aOR = 1.99) workers than among White workers; among Hispanic workers (aOR = 1.80) than among non-Hispanic workers; and among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical workers (aOR = 1.86) than among nonclinical workers.

"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minorities in the United States and has been devastating for residents of nursing homes (NHs). However, evidence on racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19-related mortality rates within NHs and how that has changed over time has been limited. This study examines the impact of a high proportion of minority residents in NHs on COVID-19-related mortality rates over a 30-week period. DESIGN: Longitudinal study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Nursing Home COVID-19 Public Use File data from 50 states from June 1, 2020, to December 27,?2020. METHODS: We linked data from 11,718 NHs to (1) Nursing Home Compare data, (2) the Long-Term Care: Facts on Care in the U.S., and (3) US county-level data on COVID cases and deaths. Our primary independent variable was proportion of minority residents (blacks and Hispanics) in NHs and its association with mortality rate over time. RESULTS: During the first 6?weeks from June 1, 2020, NHs with a higher proportion of black residents reported more COVID-19 deaths per 1000 followed by NHs with a higher proportion of Hispanic residents. Between 7 and 12?weeks, NHs with a higher proportion of Hispanic residents reported more deaths per 1000, followed by NHs with a higher proportion of black residents. However, after 23?weeks (mid-November 2020), NHs serving a higher proportion of white residents reported more deaths per 1000 than NHs serving a high proportion of black and Hispanic residents. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The disparities in COVID-19-related mortality for nursing homes serving minority residents is evident for the first 12?weeks of our study period.

"INTRODUCTION: Decisions about influenza vaccination for fall-winter 2020 were made against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. During May 2020, the authors examined intended vaccination in the next 12?months in relationship to demographic variables, healthcare attitudes, and personal COVID-19 experiences for two samples of adults--those who did not receive influenza vaccine during the prior 12?months, and those who did. METHODS: In May 2020, a cross-sectional online survey was conducted with a national US sample. Participants reported prior influenza vaccination (yes/no during prior 12?months) and anticipated vaccination (yes/no during next 12?months). Covariates included demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, race-ethnicity, political ideology), general beliefs (e.g., benefits of vaccines, altruistic attitudes), and COVID-19 health beliefs and experiences (COVID-19 worry and severity, perception of COVID-19 as a community threat, knowing someone with COVID-19). For each group, hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was conducted with intent to vaccinate as the outcome. RESULTS: Among participants (n?=?3502), 47% did not receive influenza vaccine in the prior 12?months and 53% had; 25.5% of non-vaccinators and 91.9% of vaccinators intended future vaccination. For non-vaccinators, odds of intending vaccination was associated with race/ethnicity (Hispanics were more likely to intend than white-NH; AOR?=?1.74; 95% CI?=?1.23-2.4), greater perceived benefits of vaccination (AOR?=?2.19; 95% CI?=?1.88-2.54), and perception of COVID-19 as a community threat (AOR?=?1.91; 95% CI?=?1.49-2.45). For vaccinators, odds of intending vaccination was associated with age (AOR?=?1.04; 95% CI?=?1.03-1.05), race/ethnicity (Black-NH and Other-NH were less likely to intend than white-NH, AOR?=?0.60; 95% CI?=?0.36-0.999; and AOR?=?0.45; 95% CI?=?0.24-0.84, respectively), greater perceived benefits of vaccination (AOR?=?1.88; 95% CI?=?1.45-2.45) and greater perception of collective benefits of vaccines (AOR?=?1.48; 95% CI?=?1.15-1.90).

"OBJECTIVES: Regarding severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, it is known that a substantial percentage of the adult population does not become infected when exposed to this novel coronavirus. Several studies provide an initial indication of the possible role of pre-existing immunity, whether cross-immunity or not. The possible role of latent tuberculosis (TB) and malaria has been suggested to create innate cross heterogeneous immunity. In this study, we looked for the influence of these factors on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality in malaria-endemic countries. STUDY DESIGN: Eighty malaria-endemic countries were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Data subjected to testing included TB prevalence, Bacillus Calmette-Gu¨¦rin (BCG) vaccine coverage, malaria incidence, and COVID-19 mortality. METHODS: Hierarchical multiple regression type of analysis was used for data analyses. TB prevalence per 100,000 population standardized to BCG coverage rates was taken as a direct factor in the test. Malaria incidence per 1000 population was considered an intermediate factor. The outcome was COVID-19 mortality per million population. RESULTS: The results showed with robust statistical support that standardized TB prevalence was significantly associated with reduced COVID-19 mortality. Malaria had an additional effect in reducing COVID-19 mortality, with a highly significant association. CONCLUSIONS: Malaria and standardized TB prevalence are statistically significant factors associated negatively with COVID-19 mortality.","Raham, T F",,MEDLINE,COVID-19/mortality; Endemic Diseases; Malaria/epidemiology; Tuberculosis/epidemiology; BCG Vaccine/administration &amp;amp; dosage; Cross-Sectional Studies; Global Health/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Humans; Prevalence; Protective Factors; Tuberculosis/prevention &amp;amp; control; Vaccination Coverage/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data,20210308.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.02.018,covidwho-1117519,1476-5616,,Public Health,en,NL,2021.0,"Public Health;194: 33-35, 2021 May.

"Since the initial identification of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in December of 2019, researchers have raced to understand its pathogenesis and begun devising vaccine and treatment strategies. An accurate understanding of the body&#039;s temporal immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is paramount to successful vaccine development and disease progression monitoring. To provide insight into the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2, plasma samples from 181 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients collected at various timepoints post-symptom onset (PSO) were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies via lateral flow. Additionally, 21 donors were tracked over time to elucidate patient-specific immune responses. We found sustained levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies past 130 days PSO, with 99% positivity observed at 31-60 days PSO. By 61-90 days PSO, the percentage of IgM-/IgG+ results were nearly equal to that of IgM+/IgG+ results, demonstrating a shift in the immune response with a decrease in IgM antibody levels. Results from this study not only provide evidence that the antibody response to COVID-19 can persist for over 4 months, but also demonstrates the ability of Easy Check&amp;#8482; to monitor seroconversion and antibody response of patients. Easy Check was sufficiently sensitive to detect antibodies in patient samples as early as 1-4 days PSO with 86% positivity observed at 5-7 days PSO. Further studies are required to determine the longevity and efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and whether they are protective against re-infection.","Higgins, Renee L; Rawlings, Stephen A; Case, Jamie; Lee, Florence Y; Chan, Clarence W; Barrick, Bethany; Burger, Zoe C; Yeo, Kiang-Teck J; Marrinucci, Dena",,MEDLINE,"Antibodies, Viral/blood; COVID-19/blood; Immunoglobulin G/blood; Immunoglobulin M/blood; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Viral/immunology; COVID-19/immunology; COVID-19 Serological Testing/instrumentation; COVID-19 Serological Testing/methods; Equipment Design; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin G/immunology; Immunoglobulin M/immunology; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; SARS-CoV-2/isolation &amp;amp; purification; Young Adult",20210308.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247797,covidwho-1117476,1932-6203,3,PLoS One,en,US,2021.0,"PLoS One;16(3): e0247797, 2021.

"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has afflicted tens of millions of people, fostering and unprecedent effort in vaccine development and distribution. Healthcare workers (HCW) play a key role in vaccine promotion and patient guidance, and it is likely that hesitancy among this population will have a major impact on the adoption of a successful immunization policy. To investigate HCW attitudes towards anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) vaccination, we developed an anonymous online cross-sectional survey. 1723 Italian HCW responded. Overall, 1155 (67%) intended to be vaccinated, while 443 (26%) were not sure and 125 (7%) declared refusal. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with hesitancy were using Facebook as the main information source and being a non-physician HCW, while predictors of acceptance included younger age, being in close contact with high-risk groups and having received flu vaccination during the 2019-2020 season. Reasons for hesitancy included lack of trust in vaccine safety (85%) and receiving little (78%) or conflicting (69%) information about vaccines. According to our results, adequate investment in vaccine education for healthcare personnel appears to be urgently needed, prioritizing non-physicians and information quality spread through social media. We hope that our data could help governments and policy-makers to target communication in the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination campaign.","Di Gennaro, Francesco; Murri, Rita; Segala, Francesco Vladimiro; Cerruti, Lorenzo; Abdulle, Amina; Saracino, Annalisa; Bavaro, Davide Fiore; Fantoni, Massimo",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Health Personnel/psychology; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; Vaccination Refusal/psychology; Adult; COVID-19/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Humans; Italy/epidemiology; Male; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination Refusal/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data",20210305.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v13030371,covidwho-1115434,1999-4915,3,Viruses,en,CH,2021.0,Viruses;13(3)2021 02 26. ,Attitudes towards Anti-SARS-CoV2 Vaccination among Healthcare Workers: Results from a National Survey in Italy.,article,,,13
"Background: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major threat to public health and has had a significant impact on all aspects of life. An effective vaccine is the most anticipated resolution. This study aims to evaluate Jordanian intent to be vaccinated. Methods: This is a cross-sectional web-based study. Sample characteristics were gathered, and the participants were classified according to the degree of COVID-19 risk based on the categories of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Participants&#039; KAP toward COVID-19 were assessed, and two scores were calculated: knowledge score and practice score. The association between different sample characteristics and these scores was identified using binary logistical regressions. The participants&#039; vaccination intention was evaluated and multinomial logistic regression was applied to identify the predictors of vaccination intention. Finally, the reasons behind the participants&#039; vaccination refusal/hesitation were determined and categorized into different groups. Results: 1,144 participants were enrolled in the study (females = 66.5%). 30.4% of the participants were at high risk of COVID-19 complications, and 27.5% were at medium risk. Overall, participants&#039; knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, transmission methods, protective measures, and availability of cure were high (median of knowledge score = 17 out of 21). High protective practices were followed by many participants (median of practice score = 7 out of 10). 3.7% of participants were infected, and 6.4% suspected they were infected with the COVID-19 virus. 36.8% of the participants answered &quot;No&quot; when asked if they would take the vaccine once it becomes available, and 26.4% answered, &quot;Not sure.&quot; The main reasons for the participants&#039; vaccination refusal or hesitancy were concerns regarding the use of vaccines and a lack of trust in them. Conclusion: Participants reported high refusal/hesitancy. Several barriers were identified, and efforts should be intensified to overcome these barriers.","Al-Qerem, Walid A; Jarab, Anan S",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19 Vaccines; COVID-19; Patient Compliance; Vaccination; Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Middle East/epidemiology; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Viral Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; Young Adult",20210303.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.632914,covidwho-1110369,2296-2565,,Front Public Health,en,CH,2021.0,"Front Public Health;9: 632914, 2021.

"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic presents a great public health challenge worldwide, especially given the urgent need to identify effective drugs and develop a vaccine in a short period of time. Globally, several drugs and vaccine candidates are in clinical trials. However, because these drugs and vaccines are still being tested, there is still no definition of which ones will succeed. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the opinions of over 1000 virus researchers with knowledge on the prevention and treatment of coronavirus-related human diseases to determine the most promising drug and vaccine candidates to address COVID-19. METHODS: We mapped the clinical trials related to COVID-19 registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. These data were used to prepare a survey questionnaire about treatments and vaccine candidates for COVID-19. In May 2020, a global survey was conducted with authors of recent scientific publications indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection related to viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, coronaviruses, and COVID-19. RESULTS: Remdesivir, immunoglobulin from cured patients, and plasma were considered to be the most promising treatments in May 2020, while ChAdOx1 and mRNA-1273 were considered to be the most promising vaccine candidates. Almost two-thirds of the respondents (766/1219, 62.8%) believed that vaccines for COVID-19 were likely to be available in the next 18 months. Slightly fewer than 25% (289/1219, 23.7%) believed that a vaccine was feasible, but probably not within 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: The issues addressed in this study are constantly evolving; therefore, the current state of knowledge has changed since the survey was conducted. However, for several months after the survey, the respondents&#039; expectations were in line with recent results related to treatments and vaccine candidates for COVID-19.","Cabral, Bernardo Pereira; Braga, Luiza; Mota, Fabio",,MEDLINE,COVID-19 Vaccines; COVID-19/drug therapy; Expert Testimony; Pandemics; Research Personnel; COVID-19/epidemiology; Clinical Trials as Topic; Cross-Sectional Studies; Global Health; Humans,20210302.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/22483,covidwho-1105949,2369-2960,2,JMIR Public Health Surveill,en,CA,2021.0,"JMIR Public Health Surveill;7(2): e22483, 2021 02 26.

"BACKGROUND: The psychological effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and response are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To understand the effects of the pandemic and response on anxiety and health utility in a nationally representative sample of US adults. DESIGN: A de-identified, cross-sectional survey was administered at the end of April 2020. Probability weights were assigned using estimates from the 2018 American Community Survey and Integrated Public Use Microdata Series Estimates. PARTICIPANTS: US adults 18-85?years of age with landline, texting-enabled cellphone, or internet access. INTERVENTION: Seven split-half survey blocks of 30 questions, assessing demographics, COVID-19-related health attitudes, and standardized measures of generalized self-efficacy, anxiety, depression, personality, and generic health utility. MAIN MEASURES: State/Trait anxiety scores, EQ-5D-3L Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, and demographic predictors of these scores. KEY RESULTS: Among 4855 respondents, 56.7% checked COVID-19-related news several times daily, and 84.4% at least once daily. Only 65.7% desired SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for themselves, and 70.1% for their child. Mean state anxiety (S-anxiety) score was significantly higher than mean trait anxiety (T-anxiety) score (44.9, 95%CI 43.5-46.3 vs. 41.6, 95%CI 38.7-44.5; p = 0.03), with both scores significantly higher than previously published norms. In an adjusted regression model, less frequent news viewing was associated with significantly lower S-anxiety score. Mean EQ-5D-3L VAS score for the population was significantly lower vs. established US normative data (71.4 CI 67.4-75.5, std. error 2 vs. societal mean 80, std. error 0.1; p &lt; 0.001). EQ-5D-3L VAS score was bimodal (highest with hourly and no viewing) and significantly reduced with less media viewership in an adjusted model. CONCLUSIONS: Among a nationally representative sample, there were higher S-anxiety and lower EQ-5D-3L VAS scores compared to non-pandemic normative data, indicative of a potential detrimental acute effect of the pandemic. More frequent daily media viewership was significantly associated with higher S-anxiety but also predictive of higher health utility, as measured by EQ-5D-3L VAS scores.","Greenhawt, Matthew; Kimball, Spencer; DunnGalvin, Audrey; Abrams, Elissa M; Shaker, Marcus S; Mosnaim, Giselle; Comberiati, Pasquale; Nekliudov, Nikita A; Blyuss, Oleg; Teufel, Martin; Munblit, Daniel",,MEDLINE,COVID-19; Pandemics; Adult; Anxiety/diagnosis; Anxiety/epidemiology; COVID-19 Vaccines; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Status; Humans; Quality of Life; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires,20210301.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11606-020-06554-y,covidwho-1100990,1525-1497,5,J Gen Intern Med,en,US,2021.0,"J Gen Intern Med;36(5): 1327-1337, 2021 05.

"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau provided updates on the novel coronavirus and the government&#039;s responses to the pandemic in his daily briefings from March 13 to May 22, 2020, delivered on the official Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) YouTube channel. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine comments on Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau&#039;s COVID-19 daily briefings by YouTube users and track these comments to extract the changing dynamics of the opinions and concerns of the public over time. METHODS: We used machine learning techniques to longitudinally analyze a total of 46,732 English YouTube comments that were retrieved from 57 videos of Prime Minister Trudeau&#039;s COVID-19 daily briefings from March 13 to May 22, 2020. A natural language processing model, latent Dirichlet allocation, was used to choose salient topics among the sampled comments for each of the 57 videos. Thematic analysis was used to classify and summarize these salient topics into different prominent themes. RESULTS: We found 11 prominent themes, including strict border measures, public responses to Prime Minister Trudeau&#039;s policies, essential work and frontline workers, individuals&#039; financial challenges, rental and mortgage subsidies, quarantine, government financial aid for enterprises and individuals, personal protective equipment, Canada and China&#039;s relationship, vaccines, and reopening. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to longitudinally investigate public discourse and concerns related to Prime Minister Trudeau&#039;s daily COVID-19 briefings in Canada. This study contributes to establishing a real-time feedback loop between the public and public health officials on social media. Hearing and reacting to real concerns from the public can enhance trust between the government and the public to prepare for future health emergencies.","Zheng, Chengda; Xue, Jia; Sun, Yumin; Zhu, Tingshao",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19; Federal Government; Natural Language Processing; Public Health; Public Opinion; Social Media; COVID-19 Vaccines; Canada; Emigration and Immigration; Financial Stress; Financing, Government; Government; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Public Policy; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2; Unsupervised Machine Learning",20210225.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/23957,covidwho-1097248,1438-8871,2,J Med Internet Res,en,CA,2021.0,"J Med Internet Res;23(2): e23957, 2021 02 23.

"Importance: Medical research has not equitably included members of racial/ethnic minority groups or female and older individuals. There are limited data on participant demographic characteristics in vaccine trials despite the importance of these data to current trials aimed at preventing coronavirus disease 2019. Objective: To investigate whether racial/ethnic minority groups and female and older adults are underrepresented among participants in vaccine clinical trials. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study examined data from completed US-based vaccine trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov from July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2020. The terms vaccine, vaccination, immunization, and inoculation were used to identify trials. Only those addressing vaccine immunogenicity or efficacy of preventative vaccines were included. Main Outcomes and Measures: The numbers and percentages of racial/ethnic minority, female, and older individuals compared with US census data from 2011 and 2018. Secondary outcome measures were inclusion by trial phase and year of completion. Results: A total of 230 US-based trials with 219a?¡¥555 participants were included in the study. Most trials were randomized (180 [78.3%]), included viral vaccinations (159 [69.1%]), and represented all trial phases. Every trial reported age and sex; 134 (58.3%) reported race and 79 (34.3%) reported ethnicity. Overall, among adult study participants, White individuals were overrepresented (77.9%; 95% CI, 77.4%-78.4%), and Black or African American individuals (10.6%; 95% CI, 10.2%-11.0%) and American Indian or Alaska Native individuals (0.4%; 95% CI, 0.3%-0.5%) were underrepresented compared with US census data; enrollment of Asian individuals was similar (5.7%; 95% CI, 5.5%-6.0%). Enrollment of Hispanic or Latino individuals (11.6%; 95% CI, 11.1%-12.0%) was also low even among the limited number of adult trials reporting ethnicity. Adult trials were composed of more female participants (75a?¡¥325 [56.0%]), but among those reporting age as a percentage, enrollment of participants who were aged 65 years or older was low (12.1%; 95% CI, 12.0%-12.3%). Black or African American participants (10.1%; 95% CI, 9.7%-10.6%) and Hispanic or Latino participants (22.5%; 95% CI, 21.6%-23.4%) were also underrepresented in pediatric trials. Among trials reporting race/ethnicity, 65 (48.5%) did not include American Indian or Alaska Native participants and 81 (60.4%) did not include Hawaiian or Pacific Islander participants. Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study found that among US-based vaccine clinical trials, members of racial/ethnic minority groups and older adults were underrepresented, whereas female adults were overrepresented. These findings suggest that diversity enrollment targets should be included for all vaccine trials targeting epidemiologically important infections.","Flores, Laura E; Frontera, Walter R; Andrasik, Michele P; Del Rio, Carlos; Mondr¨ªguez-Gonz¨¢lez, Antonio; Price, Stephanie A; Krantz, Elizabeth M; Pergam, Steven A; Silver, Julie K",,MEDLINE,"Clinical Trials as Topic/standards; Ethnic Groups/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Patient Selection; Sexism/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Vaccines; Adult; African Continental Ancestry Group/ethnology; African Continental Ancestry Group/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asian Continental Ancestry Group/ethnology; Asian Continental Ancestry Group/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Continental Population Groups/ethnology; Continental Population Groups/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Cross-Sectional Studies; European Continental Ancestry Group/ethnology; European Continental Ancestry Group/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Oceanic Ancestry Group/ethnology; Oceanic Ancestry Group/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Sexism/ethnology",20210223.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.37640,covidwho-1092150,2574-3805,2,JAMA Netw Open,en,US,2021.0,"JAMA Netw Open;4(2): e2037640, 2021 02 01.

"BACKGROUND: Vaccine hesitancy is a global threat undermining control of preventable infections. Emerging evidence suggests that hesitancy to COVID-19 vaccination varies globally. Qatar has a unique population with around 90% of the population being economic migrants, and the degree and determinants of hesitancy are not known. METHODS: This study was carried out to evaluate the degree of vaccine hesitancy and its socio-demographic and attitudinal determinants across a representative sample. A national cross-sectional study using validated hesitancy measurement tool was carried out from October 15, 2020, to November 15, 2020. A total of 7821 adults completed the survey. Relevant socio-demographic data along with attitudes and beliefs around COVID-19 vaccination were collected from the respondents. RESULTS: 20.2% of the respondents stated they would not take the vaccine and 19.8% reported being unsure about taking the prospective COVID-19 vaccine. Citizens and females were more likely to be vaccine hesitators than immigrants and males, respectively. Concerns around the safety of COVID-19 vaccine and its longer-term side effects were the main concerns cited. Personal research around COVID-19 and vaccine were by far the most preferred methods that would increase confidence in accepting the vaccine across all demographic groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports an overall vaccine hesitancy of 20% toward the COVID-19 vaccine and the influence of social media on attitudes toward vaccination which is in keeping with emerging evidence. This finding comes at a time that is close to the start of mass immunization and reports from a migrant-majority population highlighting important socio-demographic determinants around vaccine hesitancy.","Alabdulla, Majid; Reagu, Shuja Mohd; Al-Khal, Abdullatif; Elzain, Marwa; Jones, Roland M",,MEDLINE,"Attitude; COVID-19 Vaccines/immunology; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; Transients and Migrants; Vaccination/psychology; Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Intention; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Patient Acceptance of Health Care",20210223.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/irv.12847,covidwho-1091047,1750-2659,3,Influenza Other Respir Viruses,en,GB,2021.0,"Influenza Other Respir Viruses;15(3): 361-370, 2021 05.

"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has unprecedented consequences on population health, with governments worldwide issuing stringent public health directives. In the absence of a vaccine, a key way to control the pandemic is through behavioural change: people adhering to transmission-reducing behaviours (TRBs), such as physical distancing, hand washing and wearing face covering. Non-adherence may be explained by theories of how people think about the illness (the common-sense model of self-regulation) and/or how they think about the TRBs (social cognition theory and protection motivation theory). In addition, outbreaks of infectious diseases and the measures employed to curb them are likely to have detrimental effects on people&#039;s mental and general health. Therefore, in representative repeated surveys, we will apply behavioural theories to model adherence to TRBs and the effects on mental and general health in the Scottish population from June to November 2020, following the initial outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Repeated 20 min structured telephone surveys will be conducted with nationally representative random samples of 500 adults in Scotland. The first 6 weeks the survey will be conducted weekly, thereafter fortnightly, for a total of 14 waves (total n=7000). Ipsos MORI will recruit participants through random digit dialling. The core survey will measure the primary outcomes of adherence to TRBs, mental and general health, and explanatory variables from the theories. Further questions will be added, enabling more detailed measurement of constructs in the core survey, additional themes and questions that align with the evolving pandemic. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for this study was granted by the Life Sciences and Medicine College Ethics Review Board (CERB) at the University of Aberdeen (CERB/2020/5/1942). Results will be made available to policy makers, funders, interested lay people and other researchers through weekly reports and three bimonthly bulletins placed on the CHARIS website and advertised through social media.","Den Daas, Chantal; Hubbard, Gill; Johnston, Marie; Dixon, Diane",,MEDLINE,COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; COVID-19/psychology; Communicable Disease Control; Patient Compliance; Research Design; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Observational Studies as Topic; Pandemics; Scotland/epidemiology; Surveys and Questionnaires,20210223.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044135,covidwho-1090930,2044-6055,2,BMJ Open,en,GB,2021.0,"BMJ Open;11(2): e044135, 2021 02 18.

"INTRODUCTION: The global abrupt progression of the COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt critical life-saving services such as routine immunization (RI), thus increasing the susceptibility of countries to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). Being endemic to several infectious diseases, Lebanon might be at increased risk of outbreaks as the utilization of RI services might have deteriorated due to the pandemic and the country&#039;s political unrest following the October 2019 uprising. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in the utilization of RI services in both the public and private sectors following the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A self-administered cross-sectional survey was completed electronically, in April 2020, by 345 private pediatricians who are registered in professional associations of physicians in Lebanon and provide immunization services at their clinics. Means of the reported percentages of decrease in the utilization of vaccination services by pediatricians were calculated. As for the public sector, an examination of the monthly differences in the number of administered vaccine doses in addition to their respective percentages of change was performed. Adjustment for the distribution of RI services between the sectors was performed to calculate the national decrease rate. RESULTS: The utilization of vaccination services at the national level decreased by 31%. In the private sector, immunization services provision diminished by 46.9% mainly between February and April 2020. The highest decrease rates were observed for oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) and hepatitis A, followed by measles and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. The number of vaccine doses administered in the public sector decreased by 20%. The most prominent reductions were detected for the OPV and measles vaccines, and during October 2019 and March 2020. CONCLUSION: The substantial decrease in the utilization of RI as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic requires public health interventions to prevent future outbreaks of VPDs.","Mansour, Ziad; Arab, Jinan; Said, Racha; Rady, Alissar; Hamadeh, Randa; Gerbaka, Bernard; Bizri, Abdul Rahman",,MEDLINE,Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; COVID-19/immunology; COVID-19/psychology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Immunization/methods; Immunization/psychology; Immunization Programs/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Immunization Schedule; Infant; Lebanon/epidemiology; Male; Pandemics; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/psychology; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; SARS-CoV-2/pathogenicity; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Vaccination Coverage/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage,20210222.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246951,covidwho-1088760,1932-6203,2,PLoS One,en,US,2021.0,"PLoS One;16(2): e0246951, 2021.

"BACKGROUND: Despite increasing evidence to support mask effectiveness in mitigating the spread of COVID-19, there is still raging controversy regarding the use of masks. Evaluation of public perceptions, attitudes and the individuals&#039; experience towards mask-wearing is integral to ensuring reasonable compliance and allows authorities to address concerns held by the population. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of lay-people was conducted within a high volume tertiary level institution in Singapore, from 16 October to 16 November 2020. Surveys administered evaluated five questions: 1) duration of mask wear per day, 2) mask-type used, 3) perceived necessity, 4) discomfort level experienced and 5) causes for discomfort. RESULTS: Out of 402 respondents, 67.2% primarily wore disposable surgical masks. 72% felt mask-wearing was necessary to control COVID-19 transmission. 78.4% reported discomfort while wearing masks, with mean discomfort levels of 4.21 out of 10. Impairment to breathing and communication difficulties were the most common discomforts faced. Younger respondents complained of higher incidence of dermatological issues and sweating (p?&lt;?0.05). Respondents who wore masks for longer duration reported higher incidence of dermatological issues (p?=?0.001) and sweating (p?=?0.032). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Even with an available vaccine, adjunctive public health measures such as mask-wearing will likely continue in order to curb COVID-19 transmission. Experience from past pandemics is likely to propagate self-protective behavior within a community. Our study identified several common mask-wearing discomforts, allowing respective organizations valuable market feedback for research and development. With appropriate public attitudes, effective mask-wearing compliance can be attained in a concerted effort against the coronavirus.","Cheok, Gideon J W; Gatot, Cheryl; Sim, Craigven H S; Ng, Y H; Tay, Kenny X K; Howe, T S; Koh, Joyce S B",,MEDLINE,"Attitude; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Masks; SARS-CoV-2; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Communication; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; N95 Respirators; Young Adult",20210222.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idh.2021.01.002,covidwho-1086961,2468-0869,2,Infect Dis Health,en,NL,2021.0,"Infect Dis Health;26(2): 145-151, 2021 05.

"The implementation of strategies to mitigate possible cases of COVID-19 were addressed at the University of Alicante for the safe reopening of the 2020/2021 academic year. To discover the prevalence of immunity against SARS-CoV-2, a study was designed using a rapid immunoassay test (carried out between 6 and 22 July 2020), and in addition a cross-sectional survey was conducted on risk factors, symptoms, predisposition for becoming vaccinated, and sources of information about COVID-19. A random sample, stratified by students, faculty, and administrative staff, was selected. The seroprevalence found was 2.64% (39/1479; 95% CI 1.8-3.4), and the adjusted seroprevalence was 2.89% (95% CI 2.1-3.7). The average age of the students was 23.2 years old, and 47.6 years old for staff. In relation to COVID-19, the following was found: 17.7% pauci-symptomatic, 1.3% symptomatic, 5.5% contact with cases, 4.9% confined, and 0.3% PCR positive. More than 90% complied with preventive measures. The proportion willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was 91%. Their sources of information were the Internet (74%) and television (70.1%). They requested that the university offer information (45.1%), training (27%), and provide Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (26.3%). Lastly, 87.9% would repeat the test.

In a multivariable regression model, belonging to the middle and high-income category (OR = 1.85, CI: 1.46-2.35 and OR = 2.91, CI: 2.15-3.93, respectively), being tested for COVID-19 (OR = 4.71, CI: 3.62-6.12; p &lt; 0.001), COVID-19 community vaccine acceptance (OR = 14.45, CI: 2.91-71.65; p = 0.001) and acknowledging the existence of COVID-19 (OR = 6.04, CI: 4.42-8.23; p &lt; 0.001) were associated with an increased willingness to be vaccinated. Being a healthcare worker was associated with a decreased willingness for vaccination (OR = 0.46, CI: 0.36-0.58; p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, the current willingness for COVID-19 vaccination among citizens of the DRC is too low to dramatically decrease community transmission. Of great concern is the low intention of immunization among healthcare workers. A large sensitization campaign will be needed to increase COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.","Ditekemena, John D; Nkamba, Dalau M; Mutwadi, Armand; Mavoko, Hypolite M; Siewe Fodjo, Joseph Nelson; Luhata, Christophe; Obimpeh, Michael; Van Hees, Stijn; Nachega, Jean B; Colebunders, Robert",,MEDLINE,,20210219.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9020153,covidwho-1085032,2076-393X,2,,en,CH,2021.0,Vaccines (Basel);9(2)2021 Feb 14. ,COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance in the Democratic Republic of Congo: A Cross-Sectional Survey.,article,,,9
"People living in urban slums or informal settlements are among the most vulnerable communities, highly susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and vulnerable to the consequences of the measures taken to control the spread of the virus. Fear and stigma related to infection, mistrust between officials and the population, the often-asymptomatic nature of the disease is likely to lead to under-reporting. We conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the seroprevalence of COVID-19 infection in a large slum in South India 3 months after the index case and recruited 499 adults (age &gt;18 years). The majority (74.3%) were females and about one-third of the population reported comorbidities. The overall seroprevalence of IgG antibody for COVID-19 was 57.9% (95% CI 53.4-62.3). Age, education, occupation and the presence of reported comorbidities were not associated with seroprevalence (P-value &gt;0.05). Case-to-undetected-infections ratio was 1:195 and infection fatality rate was calculated as 2.94 per 10 000 infections. We estimated seroprevalence of COVID-19 was very high in our study population. The focus in this slum should shift from infection prevention to managing the indirect consequences of the pandemic. We recommend seroprevalence studies in such settings before vaccination to identify the vulnerability of COVID-19 infection to optimise the use of insufficient resources. It is a wake-up call to societies and nations, to dedicate paramount attention to slums into recovery and beyond - to build, restore and maintain health equity for the &#039;Health and wellbeing of all&#039;.","George, Carolin Elizabeth; Inbaraj, Leeberk Raja; Chandrasingh, Sindhulina; de Witte, L P",,MEDLINE,COVID-19/epidemiology; Poverty Areas; Adult; Age Factors; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; India/epidemiology; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vulnerable Populations/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Young Adult,20210218.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0950268821000273,covidwho-1081712,1469-4409,,Epidemiol Infect,en,GB,2021.0,"Epidemiol Infect;149: e39, 2021 02 04.

"INTRODUCTION: Vaccines against COVID-19 have been developed in unprecedented time. However, the effectiveness of any vaccine is dictated by the proportion of the population willing to be vaccinated. This observational population-based study examines intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 throughout the pandemic. METHODS: In November 2020, longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of 7,547 U.S. adults enrolled in the Understanding America Study were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression. Participants reported being willing, undecided, and unwilling to get vaccinated against COVID-19 across 13 assessments conducted from April to October 2020. Public attitudes to vaccination against COVID-19 were also assessed on a 4-point Likert-type scale. RESULTS: Willingness to vaccinate declined from 71% in April to 53.6% in October. This was explained by an increase in the percentage of participants undecided about vaccinating (from 10.5% to 14.4%) and the proportion of the sample unwilling to vaccinate (from 18.5% to 32%). The population subgroups most likely to be undecided/unwilling to vaccinate were those without a degree (undecided: RR=2.47, 95% CI=2.04, 3.00; unwilling: RR=1.92, 95% CI=1.67, 2.20), Black participants (undecided: RR=2.18, 95% CI=1.73, 2.74; unwilling: RR=1.98, 95% CI=1.63, 2.42), and female participants (undecided: RR=1.41, 95% CI=1.20, 1.65; unwilling: RR=1.29, 95% CI=1.14, 1.46). Participants who were older or were on higher incomes were least likely to be undecided or unwilling to vaccinate. Concerns about potential side effects of a vaccine were common. CONCLUSIONS: Intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 have declined rapidly during the pandemic, and close to half of Americans are undecided or unwilling to be vaccinated.","Daly, Michael; Robinson, Eric",,MEDLINE,COVID-19; Adult; COVID-19 Vaccines; Female; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; United States; Vaccination,20210218.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2021.01.008,covidwho-1081230,1873-2607,6,Am J Prev Med,en,NL,2021.0,"Am J Prev Med;60(6): 766-773, 2021 06.

"OBJECTIVES: We studied time trends in seasonal influenza vaccination and associations with socioeconomic and health-related determinants in Switzerland, overall and in people aged &amp;#8805;65 years. DESIGN: Three cross-sectional surveys. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals who participated in the Swiss Health Surveys 2007, 2012 and 2017. We calculated the proportion reporting influenza vaccination in the last 12 months, and performed multivariable logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: We included 51 582 individuals in this analysis. The median age was 49 years (IQR 25-64), and 27 518 were women (53.3%). The proportion of reporting a history of influenza vaccination overall was 31.9% (95% CI 31.4 to 32.4); and dropped from 34.5% in 2007 to 28.8% in 2017. The uptake of vaccination within the past 12 months was 16% in 2007 and similar in 2012 and 2017 (around 14%). In people with chronic disease, uptake dropped from 43.8% in 2007 to 37.1% in 2012 and to 31.6% in 2017 (p&lt;0.001). In people aged &amp;#8805;65 years, uptake dropped from 47.8% in 2007 to 38.5% in 2012 to 36.2% in 2017 (p&lt;0.001). In logistic regression, self-reported vaccination coverage decreased in the 65-75 years old (adjusted OR (aOR) 0.56, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.66 between 2007 and 2012; aOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.03 between 2012 and 2017). Uptake was positively associated with the &amp;#8805;65 age group, living in French-speaking and urban areas, history of smoking, bad self-reported health status, private/semiprivate health insurance, having a medical profession and having any underlying chronic disease. CONCLUSION: Influenza vaccination coverage was low in older and chronically ill persons. Significant efforts are required in preparing for the influenza season 2020/2021 to reduce the double burden of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza. These efforts should include campaigns but also novel approaches using social media.","Z¨¹rcher, Kathrin; Zwahlen, Marcel; Berlin, Claudia; Egger, Matthias; Fenner, Lukas",,MEDLINE,"Influenza Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; Influenza, Human; Self Report; Vaccination/trends; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Influenza, Human/prevention &amp;amp; control; Male; Middle Aged; Pregnancy; Switzerland; Young Adult",20210212.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041354,covidwho-1075974,2044-6055,2,BMJ Open,en,GB,2021.0,"BMJ Open;11(2): e041354, 2021 02 09.

"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound and differential impacts on metropolitan areas across the United States and around the world. Within the United States, metropolitan areas that were hit earliest with the pandemic and reacted with scientifically based health policy were able to contain the virus by late spring. For other areas that kept businesses open, the first wave in the United States hit in mid-summer. As the weather turns colder, universities resume classes, and people tire of lockdowns, a second wave is ascending in both metropolitan and rural areas. It becomes more obvious that additional SARS-CoV-2 surveillance is needed at the local level to track recent shifts in the pandemic, rates of increase, and persistence. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to provide advanced surveillance metrics for COVID-19 transmission that account for speed, acceleration, jerk and persistence, and weekly shifts, to better understand and manage risk in metropolitan areas. Existing surveillance measures coupled with our dynamic metrics of transmission will inform health policy to control the COVID-19 pandemic until, and after, an effective vaccine is developed. Here, we provide values for novel indicators to measure COVID-19 transmission at the metropolitan area level. METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 260 days of COVID-19 data from public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in the 25 largest US metropolitan areas as a function of the prior number of cases and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel data model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: Minneapolis and Chicago have the greatest average number of daily new positive results per standardized 100,000 population (which we refer to as speed). Extreme behavior in Minneapolis showed an increase in speed from 17 to 30 (67%) in 1 week. The jerk and acceleration calculated for these areas also showed extreme behavior. The dynamic panel data model shows that Minneapolis, Chicago, and Detroit have the largest persistence effects, meaning that new cases pertaining to a specific week are statistically attributable to new cases from the prior week. CONCLUSIONS: Three of the metropolitan areas with historically early and harsh winters have the highest persistence effects out of the top 25 most populous metropolitan areas in the United States at the beginning of their cold weather season. With these persistence effects, and with indoor activities becoming more popular as the weather gets colder, stringent COVID-19 regulations will be more important than ever to flatten the second wave of the pandemic. As colder weather grips more of the nation, southern metropolitan areas may also see large spikes in the number of cases.","Oehmke, Theresa B; Post, Lori A; Moss, Charles B; Issa, Tariq Z; Boctor, Michael J; Welch, Sarah B; Oehmke, James F",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/epidemiology; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; COVID-19/transmission; Health Policy; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Models, Statistical; Pandemics; Public Health; Public Health Surveillance; Registries; SARS-CoV-2; United States/epidemiology",20210211.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/26081,covidwho-1073233,1438-8871,2,J Med Internet Res,en,CA,2021.0,"J Med Internet Res;23(2): e26081, 2021 02 09.

"BACKGROUND: Increasing the coverage of vaccinations recommended by the World Health Organization in the older adult population is an urgent issue, especially in the context of avoiding co-epidemics during the current coronavirus disease 2019 crisis. The aim of this study was to examine factors associated with the quality of perceived patient-physician communication and whether this variable was associated with increased odds of vaccination. METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study conducted from October 2016 to January 2017. The participants were 22,253 physically and cognitively independent individuals aged 65 or older living in 39 municipalities in Japan. Multilevel logit models were used to estimate the odds of vaccination. RESULTS: Among the participants, 40.0% and 58.8% had received pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations as per the recommended schedule, respectively. People with low educational levels were more likely to have a family physician but rate their experience in asking questions lower than those with higher educational levels. Having a family physician and high rating for physicians&#039; listening attitude were positively associated with increased odds of pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations. High rating for patients&#039; questioning attitude and shared decision-making, compared to an ambiguous attitude toward medical decision-making, were positively associated with increased odds of pneumococcal vaccination. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that promotion of having a family physician, better patient-physician communication, and shared decision-making may encourage older adults to undergo recommended vaccinations.","Sato, Koryu; Kondo, Naoki; Murata, Chiyoe; Shobugawa, Yugo; Saito, Kousuke; Kondo, Katsunori",,MEDLINE,,20210210.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.2188/jea.JE20200505,covidwho-1069681,1349-9092,,J. epidemiol,en,JP,2021.0,J Epidemiol;2021 Feb 06. ,Association of pneumococcal and influenza vaccination with patient-physician communication in older adults: A nationwide cross-sectional study from the JAGES 2016.,article,,,
"BACKGROUND: Unprecedented efforts are underway to develop COVID-19 vaccines, widely seen as critical to controlling the pandemic. Academic nursing leaders must be proactive in assuring widespread faculty and student vaccination uptake. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe nursing faculty and student nurse factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine readiness. METHODS: Cross-sectional online survey of nursing faculty and student nurses at a university affiliated with an academic medical center was conducted. FINDINGS: Most full-time faculty (60%) intended to receive the vaccine; but only 45% of adjunct faculty and students reported intending to get vaccinated. The major reasons for not getting vaccinated were vaccine safety and side effects. Collectively, participants reported a low level of knowledge related to vaccine development. DISCUSSION: As the most trusted profession, nurses will play a decisive role in counseling patients about COVID-19 risks and benefits. Findings suggest that academic nursing leaders need to consider faculty and student vaccine concerns and provide vaccine development education.","Manning, Mary Lou; Gerolamo, Angela M; Marino, Marie Ann; Hanson-Zalot, Mary E; Pogorzelska-Maziarz, Monika",,MEDLINE,,20210210.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.outlook.2021.01.019,covidwho-1068993,1528-3968,,Nurs. outlook,en,US,2021.0,Nurs Outlook;2021 Feb 05. ,COVID-19 vaccination readiness among nurse faculty and student nurses.,article,,,
"Vaccination yields the direct individual benefit of protecting recipients from infectious diseases and also the indirect social benefit of reducing the transmission of infections to others, often referred to as herd immunity This research examines how prosocial concern for vaccination, defined as people&#039;s preoccupation with infecting others if they do not vaccinate themselves, motivates vaccination in more and less populated regions of the United States. A nationally representative, longitudinal survey of 2,490 Americans showed that prosocial concern had a larger positive influence on vaccination against influenza in sparser regions, as judged by a region&#039;s nonmetropolitan status, lesser population density, and lower proportion of urban land area. Two experiments (total n = 800), one preregistered, provide causal evidence that drawing attention to prosocial (vs. individual) concerns interacted with social density to affect vaccination intentions. Specifically, prosocial concern led to stronger intentions to vaccinate against influenza and COVID-19 but only when social density was low (vs. high). Moderated mediation analyses show that, in low-density conditions, the benefits of inducing prosocial concern were due to greater perceived impact of one&#039;s vaccination on others. In this light, public health communications may reap more benefits from emphasizing the prosocial aspects of vaccination in sparser environments.","Jung, Haesung; Albarrac¨ªn, Dolores",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; COVID-19/epidemiology; Influenza Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; Influenza, Human/epidemiology; Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; COVID-19/transmission; COVID-19/virology; Female; Humans; Influenza, Human/prevention &amp;amp; control; Influenza, Human/transmission; Influenza, Human/virology; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Orthomyxoviridae/genetics; Orthomyxoviridae/immunology; Population Density; Probability; Public Health; SARS-CoV-2/genetics; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; United States/epidemiology; Vaccination; Young Adult",20210209.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2007538118,covidwho-1066035,1091-6490,1,Proc.

"BACKGROUND: It is expected that COVID-19 vaccines will become available in China by the end of 2020. Vaccinating children against COVID-19 would contribute to the control of the pandemic and the recovery of the global economy. For children under the age of 18 years, parents are usually the decision makers regarding their children&#039;s vaccination. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate parental acceptability of free COVID-19 vaccination for children under the age of 18 years in China. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional, closed online survey among 2053 factory workers in Shenzhen, China, implemented from September 1 to 7, 2020. Participants of the online survey were full-time employees aged 18 years or over who had resumed work in factories in Shenzhen. Factory workers in Shenzhen are required to receive physical examinations once a year. Eligible workers attending six designated physical examination sites were invited to complete an online survey. This study was based on a subsample of those who had at least one child under the age of 18 years (N=1052). After being briefed that COVID-19 vaccines developed by China are likely to be available by the end of 2020, participants were asked about their likelihood of having their children under the age of 18 years take up free COVID-19 vaccination provided by the government, if it existed. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to examine the associations of perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and exposure to information related to COVID-19 through social media with parental acceptability, after controlling for significant background characteristics. RESULTS: The prevalence of parents&#039; acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for their children was 72.6% (764/1052). After adjusting for significant background characteristics, positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.70, 95% CI 1.50-1.91), the perception that a family member would support them in having their children take up COVID-19 vaccination (ie, perceived subjective norm) (AOR 4.18, 95% CI 3.21-5.43), and perceived behavioral control to have the children take up COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.84, 95% CI 1.49-2.26) were associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. Regarding social media influence, higher exposure to positive information related to COVID-19 vaccination was associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.17-1.56). Higher exposure to negative information related to COVID-19 vaccination was negatively associated with the dependent variable (AOR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Parents&#039; acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for their children under 18 years of age was high in China. The TPB is a useful framework to guide the development of future campaigns promoting COVID-19 vaccination targeting parents. Transparency in communicating about the vaccine development process and vaccine safety testing is important. Public health authorities should also address misinformation in a timely manner.","Zhang, Ke Chun; Fang, Yuan; Cao, He; Chen, Hongbiao; Hu, Tian; Chen, Ya Qi; Zhou, Xiaofeng; Wang, Zixin",,MEDLINE,,20210209.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/24827,covidwho-1067572,2561-6722,2,JMIR Pediatr Parent,en,CA,2020.0,"JMIR Pediatr Parent;3(2): e24827, 2020 Dec 30.

"BACKGROUND: A pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged and affected most of the world in early 2020. To inform effective public health measures we conducted a knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) survey among a Hausa Muslim society in Nigeria in March 2020. METHODS: The study is an analytic cross-sectional survey with questionnaires administered to the general population including Health Care Workers (HCW) in Kano, Nigeria. Participants were recruited by convenience sampling following informed consent. The percentage of KAP scores were categorized as good and poor. Independent predictors of good knowledge of COVID 19 were ascertained using a binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: The questionnaire was administered among urban 32.8%, peri-urban dwellers 32.4%, and to online participants 34.8%. The peri-urban and urban participants were given paper questionnaires. There were 886 study participants with mean age 28.58yrs [SD:10.25] (Interquartile range [IQR]:22yrs-32yrs), males 55.4% with 57.3% having had or were in tertiary education. Most participants were students 40% and civil servants 20%. The overall mean [standard deviation (SD)] for knowledge, attitude and practice scores expressed in percentage was 65.38%[SD15.90], 71.45% [SD14.10], and 65.04% [SD17.02] respectively. Out of the respondents, 270(30.47%) had good knowledge (GK), 158(17.8%) had good attitude (GA), and 230(25.96%) had good practice (GP) using cut-off scores of 75%, 86.5%, and 75% respectively. Over 48% did not agree COVID-19 originated from animals while 60% perceived the pandemic to be due to God&#039;s punishment. Also, 36% thought it was a man-made virus. When rating fear, most respondents [63.5%] had marked fear i.e. &amp;#8805; 7 out of 10 and 56% admitted to modifying their habits recently in fear of contracting the virus. As regards attitude to religious norms, 77.77% agreed on cancellation of the lesser pilgrimage as a measure to curb the spread of the disease while 23.64% admitted that greater pilgrimage (Hajj) should proceed despite the persistence of the ongoing pandemic. About 50% of the respondents insisted on attending Friday congregational prayers despite social distancing. One in four people still harbored stigma towards a person who has recovered from the virus. 28% felt some races are more at risk of the disease though 66% mentioned always practicing social distancing from persons coughing or sneezing. Almost 70% of respondents said they were willing to accept a vaccine with 39% saying they would be willing to pay for it if not publicly funded. In univariate analysis increasing age and having been ever married were associated with GK while tertiary education was associated with GA [Odds Ratio; 95% Confidence Interval] 2.66(1.79-3.95). Independent positive predictors of GK were those who were or had ever been married, those who had marked fear of COVID-19, and had modified their habits in the last three months. Those who had non-tertiary education and had the questionnaire administered as paper rather than online version had GK but age was not a predictor. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of transmission and preventive measures should be improved in the general population cognizant of cultural norms and Islamic practices. The study highlights the importance of considering belief systems and perception in developing control measures against COVID-19.","Habib, Maryam Abdulrazaq; Dayyab, Farouq Muhammad; Iliyasu, Garba; Habib, Abdulrazaq G",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/ethnology; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice/ethnology; Islam/psychology; Adult; COVID-19/epidemiology; COVID-19/psychology; COVID-19/virology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Personnel/psychology; Humans; Knowledge; Male; Nigeria/epidemiology; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2/isolation &amp;amp; purification; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",20210209.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245176,covidwho-1067408,1932-6203,1,PLoS One,en,US,2021.0,"PLoS One;16(1): e0245176, 2021.

"Understanding the immune responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical in terms of protection against reinfection and, thus, for public health policy and vaccine development for COVID-19. In this study, using either live SARS-CoV-2 particles or retroviruses pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 S viral surface protein (Spike), we studied the neutralizing antibody (nAb) response in serum samples from a cohort of 140 SARS-CoV-2 qPCR-confirmed infections, including patients with mild symptoms and also more severe forms, including those that required intensive care. We show that nAb titers correlated strongly with disease severity and with anti-spike IgG levels. Indeed, patients from intensive care units exhibited high nAb titers; conversely, patients with milder disease symptoms had heterogeneous nAb titers, and asymptomatic or exclusive outpatient-care patients had no or low nAbs. We found that nAb activity in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients displayed a relatively rapid decline after recovery compared to individuals infected with other coronaviruses. Moreover, we found an absence of cross-neutralization between endemic coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, indicating that previous infection by human coronaviruses may not generate protective nAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we found that the D614G mutation in the spike protein, which has recently been identified as the current major variant in Europe, does not allow neutralization escape. Altogether, our results contribute to our understanding of the immune correlates of SARS-CoV-2-induced disease, and rapid evaluation of the role of the humoral response in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is warranted.","Legros, Vincent; Denolly, Sol¨¨ne; Vogrig, Manon; Boson, Bertrand; Siret, Eglantine; Rigaill, Josselin; Pillet, Sylvie; Grattard, Florence; Gonzalo, Sylvie; Verhoeven, Paul; Allatif, Omran; Berthelot, Philippe; P¨¦lissier, Carole; Thiery, Guillaume; Botelho-Nevers, Elisabeth; Millet, Guillaume; Morel, J¨¦r?me; Paul, St¨¦phane; Walzer, Thierry; Cosset, Fran?ois-Lo?c; Bourlet, Thomas; Pozzetto, Bruno",,MEDLINE,"Antibodies, Neutralizing/immunology; Antibodies, Viral/immunology; COVID-19 Serological Testing; COVID-19/immunology; COVID-19/pathology; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; Severity of Illness Index; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Amino Acid Substitution; Antibodies, Neutralizing/blood; Antibodies, Viral/blood; COVID-19/blood; COVID-19/virology; Female; Humans; Kinetics; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus/genetics; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus/immunology",20210204.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41423-020-00588-2,covidwho-1060623,2042-0226,2,Cell Mol Immunol,en,CN,2021.0,"Cell Mol Immunol;18(2): 318-327, 2021 02.

"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound global impact on governments, health care systems, economies, and populations around the world. Within the East Asia and Pacific region, some countries have mitigated the spread of the novel coronavirus effectively and largely avoided severe negative consequences, while others still struggle with containment. As the second wave reaches East Asia and the Pacific, it becomes more evident that additional SARS-CoV-2 surveillance is needed to track recent shifts, rates of increase, and persistence associated with the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to provide advanced surveillance metrics for COVID-19 transmission that account for speed, acceleration, jerk, persistence, and weekly shifts, to better understand country risk for explosive growth and those countries who are managing the pandemic successfully. Existing surveillance coupled with our dynamic metrics of transmission will inform health policy to control the COVID-19 pandemic until an effective vaccine is developed. We provide novel indicators to measure disease transmission. METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 330 days of COVID-19 data from public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in East Asia and the Pacific as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: The standard surveillance metrics for Indonesia, the Philippines, and Myanmar were concerning as they had the largest new caseloads at 4301, 2588, and 1387, respectively. When looking at the acceleration of new COVID-19 infections, we found that French Polynesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines had rates at 3.17, 0.22, and 0.06 per 100,000. These three countries also ranked highest in terms of jerk at 15.45, 0.10, and 0.04, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Two of the most populous countries in East Asia and the Pacific, Indonesia and the Philippines, have alarming surveillance metrics. These two countries rank highest in new infections in the region. The highest rates of speed, acceleration, and positive upwards jerk belong to French Polynesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, and may result in explosive growth. While all countries in East Asia and the Pacific need to be cautious about reopening their countries since outbreaks are likely to occur in the second wave of COVID-19, the country of greatest concern is the Philippines. Based on standard and enhanced surveillance, the Philippines has not gained control of the COVID-19 epidemic, which is particularly troubling because the country ranks 4th in population in the region. Without extreme and rigid social distancing, quarantines, hygiene, and masking to reverse trends, the Philippines will remain on the global top 5 list of worst COVID-19 outbreaks resulting in high morbidity and mortality. The second wave will only exacerbate existing conditions and increase COVID-19 transmissions.","Post, Lori Ann; Lin, Jasmine S; Moss, Charles B; Murphy, Robert Leo; Ison, Michael G; Achenbach, Chad J; Resnick, Danielle; Singh, Lauren Nadya; White, Janine; Boctor, Michael J; Welch, Sarah B; Oehmke, James Francis",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/epidemiology; Asia, Southeastern/epidemiology; Australasia/epidemiology; COVID-19/transmission; Far East/epidemiology; Health Policy; Humans; Indonesia/epidemiology; Longitudinal Studies; Malaysia/epidemiology; Pandemics; Philippines/epidemiology; Polynesia/epidemiology; Public Health; Public Health Surveillance; Registries; SARS-CoV-2",20210203.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/25454,covidwho-1058365,1438-8871,2,J Med Internet Res,en,CA,2021.0,"J Med Internet Res;23(2): e25454, 2021 02 01.

"Background: A safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 has become a public health priority. However, little is known about the public willingness to accept a future COVID-19 vaccine in China. This study aimed to understand the willingness and determinants for the acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine among Chinese adults.Methods: A cross-sectional survey using an online questionnaire was conducted in an adult population in China. Chi-square tests were used to identify differences for various intentions regarding COVID-19 vaccination. The t test was used to identify differences among vaccine hesitancy scores. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the predicated factors associated with the willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.Results: Of the 3195 eligible participants, 83.8% were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and 76.6% believed the vaccine would be beneficial to their health; however, 74.9% expressed concerns or a neutral attitude regarding its potential adverse effects. Of the participants, 76.5% preferred domestically manufactured vaccines and were more willing to be vaccinated than those who preferred imported vaccines. Multivariable logistic regression indicated that lack of confidence, complacency in regard to health, risk of the vaccine, and attention frequency were the main factors affecting the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.Conclusion: Our study indicated that the respondents in China had a high willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine, but some participants also worried about its adverse effects. Information regarding the efficacy and safety of an upcoming COVID-19 vaccine should be disseminated to ensure its acceptance and coverage.","Chen, Musha; Li, Yanjun; Chen, Jiaoshan; Wen, Ziyu; Feng, Fengling; Zou, Huachun; Fu, Chuanxi; Chen, Ling; Shu, Yuelong; Sun, Caijun",,MEDLINE,COVID-19 Vaccines; COVID-19; Adult; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination,20210203.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1853449,covidwho-1057794,2164-554X,7,Hum Vaccin Immunother,en,US,2021.0,"Hum Vaccin Immunother;17(7): 2279-2288, 2021 07 03.

"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data indicate that a large part of population needs to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. Hence, it is of high importance for public health officials to know whether people are going to get vaccinated for COVID-19. The objective of the present study was to examine the willingness of adult residents in Greece to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: A cross-sectional was survey conducted among the adult general population of Greece between April 28, 2020 to May 03, 2020 (last week of lockdown), using a mixed methodology for data collection: Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) and Computer Assisted web Interviewing (CAWI). Using a sample size calculator, the target sample size was found to be around 1000 respondents. To ensure a nationally representative sample of the urban/rural population according to the Greek census 2011, a proportionate stratified by region systematic sampling procedure was used to recruit particpants. Data collection was guided through a structured questionnaire. Regarding willingness to COVID-19 vaccination, participants were asked to answer the following question: &quot;If there was a vaccine available for the novel coronavirus, would you do it?&quot; RESULTS: Of 1004 respondents only 57.7% stated that they are going to get vaccinated for COVID-19. Respondents aged &gt; 65 years old, those who either themselves or a member of their household belonged to a vulnerable group, those believing that the COVID-19 virus was not developed in laboratories by humans, those believing that coronavirus is far more contagious and lethal compared to the H1N1 virus, and those believing that next waves are coming were statistically significantly more likely to be willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Higher knowledge score regarding symptoms, transmission routes and prevention and control measures against COVID-19 was significantly associated with higher willingness of respondents to get vaccinated. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of individuals in the general population are unwilling to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, stressing the need for public health officials to take immediate awareness-raising measures.","Kourlaba, Georgia; Kourkouni, Eleni; Maistreli, Stefania; Tsopela, Christina-Grammatiki; Molocha, Nafsika-Maria; Triantafyllou, Christos; Koniordou, Markela; Kopsidas, Ioannis; Chorianopoulou, Evangelia; Maroudi-Manta, Stefania; Filippou, Dimitrios; Zaoutis, Theoklis E",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Greece; Humans; Immunity, Herd; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Public Health",20210202.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s41256-021-00188-1,covidwho-1054852,2397-0642,1,Glob Health Res Policy,en,GB,2021.0,"Glob Health Res Policy;6(1): 3, 2021 01 29.

"BACKGROUND: As immunisation program launches have previously demonstrated, it is essential that careful planning occurs now to ensure the readiness of the public for a COVID-19 vaccine. As part of that process, this study aimed to understand the public perceptions regarding a future COVID-19 vaccine in Australia. METHODS: A national cross-sectional online survey of 1420 Australian adults (18 years and older) was undertaken between 18 and 24 March 2020. The statistical analysis of the data included univariate and multivariable logistic regression model analysis. RESULTS: Respondents generally held positive views towards vaccination. Eighty percent (n = 1143) agreed with the statement that getting myself vaccinated for COVID-19 would be a good way to protect myself against infection. Females (n = 614, 83%) were more likely to agree with the statement than males (n = 529, 78%) (aOR = 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-1.8); P = 0.03), while 91% of those aged 70 years and above agreed compared to 76% of 18-29-year-olds (aOR = 2.3 (95% CI:1.2-4.1); P = 0.008). Agreement was also higher for those with a self-reported chronic disease (aOR = 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-2.0); P = 0.04) and among those who held private health insurance (aOR = 1.7 (95% CI: 1.3-2.3); P &lt; 0.001). Beyond individual perceptions, 78% stated that their decision to vaccinate would be supported by family and friends. CONCLUSION: This study presents an early indication of public perceptions towards a future COVID-19 vaccine and represents a starting point for mapping vaccine perceptions. To support an effective launch of these new vaccines, governments need to use this time to understand the communities concerns and to identify the strategies that will support engagement.","Seale, Holly; Heywood, Anita E; Leask, Julie; Sheel, Meru; Durrheim, David N; Bolsewicz, Katarzyna; Kaur, Rajneesh",,MEDLINE,"Attitude to Health; COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; Vaccination/psychology; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Australia/epidemiology; COVID-19/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/psychology; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Young Adult",20210202.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-05833-1,covidwho-1054806,1471-2334,1,BMC Infect Dis,en,GB,2021.0,"BMC Infect Dis;21(1): 120, 2021 Jan 28.

"BACKGROUND: A healthy healthcare system requires healthy healthcare workers. Protecting healthcare workers including nurses against COVID-19 is crucial, and vaccination could be a viable future option. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a global challenge. Nurses, as a trustworthy and creditable source of vaccine-related information, may build public confidence in vaccination. Hence, research on vaccine hesitancy among nurses is warranted. OBJECTIVES: This study estimated nurses&#039; influenza vaccination behaviors and intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine when available, and examined their corresponding 5C psychological antecedents (confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility). To investigate the impact of COVID-19-related work demands, the mediation effects of work stress on the association between work demands and COVID-19 vaccination intention were also examined. DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey SETTINGS: Nurses were invited to participate via the promotion of a professional nursing organization and by personal referrals during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong between mid-March and late April 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 1,205 eligible nurses (mean age?=?40.79, SD?=?10.47; 90% being female) were included in the analyses. METHODS: Demographics, influenza vaccination, intention to have COVID-19 vaccine, the 5C vaccine hesitancy components, work stress and COVID-19-related work demands (insufficient supply of personal protective equipment, involvement in isolation rooms, and unfavorable attitudes towards workplace infection control policies) were reported in the survey. RESULTS: The influenza vaccine uptake rate and the proportion intending to take COVID-19 vaccine were 49% and 63%, respectively. Influenza vaccination was associated with working in public hospitals and all 5C constructs (more confidence, more collective responsibility and less complacency, constraints, and calculation), whereas stronger COVID-19 vaccination intention was associated with younger age, more confidence, less complacency and more collective responsibility. COVID-19-related demands were associated with greater work stress, and hence stronger COVID-19 vaccination intention. CONCLUSION: The potential uptake rate of COVID-19 vaccine among nurses was suboptimal to achieve herd immunity. The 5C constructs were useful in predicting influenza vaccination and, to a lesser extent, the intention to take COVID-19 vaccine. The uncertain attributes such as effectiveness, side effects, and effective duration of the COVID-19 vaccine may contribute to this discrepancy. With less work stress among nurses in the post-pandemic period, the intention to take COVID-19 vaccine will likely drop. The 5C constructs should be infused in vaccination campaigns. While a COVID-19 vaccine could be ready soon, the nursing profession may not be ready to accept it. More research work is needed to boost the uptake rate. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Less than two-third of nurses intended to take COVID-19 vaccine when available. While a COVID-19 vaccine could be ready soon, nursing profession is not ready to accept it.","Kwok, Kin On; Li, Kin-Kit; Wei, Wan In; Tang, Arthur; Wong, Samuel Yeung Shan; Lee, Shui Shan",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; Influenza Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; Intention; Nurses/psychology; Vaccination/psychology; Adult; Aged; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Influenza, Human/prevention &amp;amp; control; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Stress; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/psychology; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Vaccination Refusal/psychology; Young Adult",20210127.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103854,covidwho-1046378,1873-491X,,Int J Nurs Stud,en,GB,2021.0,"Int J Nurs Stud;114: 103854, 2021 Feb.

"BACKGROUND: As vaccines for the coronavirus become available, it will be important to know the rate of COVID-19 vaccine acceptability in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS), given that vaccination will be a key strategy for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections. Using a national sample of adults with MS in the United States obtained early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the current study aimed to: (1) assess willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine when available; (2) determine demographic, MS, and psychosocial correlates of vaccine willingness; and (3) measure where people with MS get their COVID-19 information and their perceived trustworthiness of such sources, which may influence COVID-19 vaccine willingness. METHODS: Adults with MS (N?=?486) living in the United States completed a cross-sectional online survey (between 10 April 2020 and 06 May 2020) about their willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccination once available. Participants also completed measures to describe the sample and to assess factors potentially related to vaccine willingness, including demographics, MS-specific variables, psychological measures, COVID-19 information sources, and perceived trustworthiness of their information sources. RESULTS: Approximately two-thirds of the participants (66.0%) reported a willingness to obtain a future COVID-19 vaccine, whereas 15.4%of the sample was unwilling. Greater willingness to receive the vaccine was associated with having a higher level of education and holding a higher perception of one&#039;s risk of catching COVID-19. Participants reported accessing COVID-19 information from many different sources. Approximately a third (31.6%) of the sample reported getting their information from healthcare providers. Healthcare providers and the National MS Society had the highest perceived trustworthiness for COVID-19 information. The perceived trustworthiness of information sources was highly associated with vaccine willingness. CONCLUSION: Early in the pandemic, willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine was not universal in this large sample or people living with MS. Vaccine willingness was associated with a few variables including education level, perceived risk for COVID-19 infection, and trust in COVID-19 information sources. These results have important implications for guiding healthcare providers and the MS community as COVID-19 vaccines become widely available.","Ehde, Dawn M; Roberts, Michelle K; Herring, Tracy E; Alschuler, Kevin N",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Multiple Sclerosis; Vaccination/psychology; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Sclerosis/epidemiology; Pandemics; United States/epidemiology; Vaccination Refusal/psychology; Young Adult",20210127.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2021.102788,covidwho-1046203,2211-0356,,Mult Scler Relat Disord,en,NL,2021.0,"Mult Scler Relat Disord;49: 102788, 2021 Apr.

"BACKGROUND: As a priority group, healthcare personnel (HCP) will be key to success of COVID-19 vaccination programs. The purpose of this study was to assess HCP willingness to get vaccinated and identify specific concerns that would undermine vaccination efforts. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of HCP, including clinical and non-clinical staff, researchers, and trainees between November 23 rd ,2020 and December 5 th ,2020. The survey evaluated attitudes, beliefs and willingness to get vaccinated. RESULTS: A total of 5287 respondents had a mean age of 42.5 years (SD=13.56), and were 72.8% female (n=3842). Overall 57.5 % of individuals expressed intent to receive COVID-19 vaccine. 80.4% were physicians and scientists representing the largest group. 33.6% of registered nurses, 31.6% of allied health professionals, and 32% of master&#039;s level clinicians were unsure they would take the vaccine (p&lt;.001). Respondents who were older, males, White, or Asian were more likely to get vaccinated compared to other groups. Vaccine safety, potential adverse events, efficacy and speed of vaccine development dominated concerns listed by participants. Fewer (54.0%) providers of direct care vs. non-care providers (62.4%), and 52.0% of those who had provided care for COVID-19 patients (vs. 60.6% of those who had not) indicated they would take the vaccine if offered (p&lt;.001). CONCLUSIONS: We observed that self-reported willingness to receive vaccination against COVID-19 differs by hospital roles, with physicians and research scientists showing the highest acceptance. These findings highlight important heterogeneity in personal attitudes among HCPs around COVID-19 vaccines and highlight a need for tailored communication strategies.","Shaw, Jana; Stewart, Telisa; Anderson, Kathryn B; Hanley, Samantha; Thomas, Stephen J; Salmon, Daniel A; Morley, Christopher",,MEDLINE,,20210127.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab054,covidwho-1045875,1537-6591,,Clin. infect. dis,en,US,2021.0,Clin Infect Dis;2021 Jan 25. ,Assessment of U.S. health care personnel (HCP) attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination in a large university health care system.,article,,,
"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a highly transmissible illness caused by SARS-CoV-2. The disease has affected more than 200 countries, and the measures that have been implemented to combat its spread, as there is still no vaccine or definitive medication, have been based on supportive interventions and drug repositioning. Brazil, the largest country in South America, has had more than 140,000 recorded deaths and is one of the most affected countries. Despite the extensive quantity of scientifically recognized information, there are still conflicting discussions on how best to face the disease and the virus, especially with regard to social distancing, preventive methods, and the use of medications. OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the Brazilian population&#039;s basic knowledge about COVID-19 to demonstrate how Brazilians are managing to identify scientifically proven information. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used. An original online questionnaire survey was administered from June 16 to August 21, 2020, across all five different geopolitical regions of the country (ie, the North, Northeast, Center-West, Southeast, and South). The questionnaire was comprised of questions about basic aspects of COVID-19, such as the related symptoms, conduct that should be followed when suspected of infection, risk groups, prevention, transmission, and social distancing. The wrong questionnaire response alternatives were taken from the fake news combat website of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Participants (aged &amp;#8805;18 years) were recruited through social networking platforms, including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter. The mean distributions, frequencies, and similarities or dissimilarities between the responses for the different variables of the study were evaluated. The significance level for all statistical tests was less than .05. RESULTS: A total of 4180 valid responses representative of all the states and regions of Brazil were recorded. Most respondents had good knowledge about COVID-19, getting an average of 86.59% of the total score with regard to the basic aspects of the disease. The region, education level, age, sex, and social condition had a significant association (P&lt;.001) with knowledge about the disease, which meant that women, the young, those with higher education levels, nonrecipients of social assistance, and more economically and socially developed regions had more correct answers. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, Brazilians with social media access have a good level of basic knowledge about COVID-19 but with differences depending on the analyzed subgroup. Due to the limitation of the platform used in carrying out the study, care should be taken when generalizing the study findings to populations with less education or who are not used to accessing social networking platforms.","Guimar?es, Vin¨ªcius Henrique Almeida; de Oliveira-Leandro, Ma¨ªsa; Cassiano, Carolina; Marques, Anna Laura Piantino; Motta, Clara; Freitas-Silva, Ana Let¨ªcia; de Sousa, Marlos Aureliano Dias; Silveira, Luciano Alves Matias; Pardi, Thiago C¨¦sar; Gazotto, Fernanda Castro; Silva, Marcos Vin¨ªcius; Rodrigues, Virmondes; Rodrigues, Wellington Francisco; Oliveira, Carlo Jose Freire",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Health Behavior; Health Education/methods; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Social Media/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Adult; Aged; Brazil; COVID-19/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Social Networking; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",20210126.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/24756,covidwho-1042210,2369-2960,1,JMIR Public Health Surveill,en,CA,2021.0,"JMIR Public Health Surveill;7(1): e24756, 2021 01 21.

"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the acceptance of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine among the general adult population in Kuwait and assess its determinants. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted by enrolling adults living in Kuwait (n = 2,368; aged &amp;#8805;21 years). Acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine was inferred if participants indicated that they &quot;definitely or probably will accept vaccination against COVID-19 once a vaccine is available.&quot; Associations were explored by applying a modified Poisson regression to estimate and infer adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: In total, 53.1% (1,257/2,368) of the participants were willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine once available. Male subjects were more willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine than females (58.3 vs. 50.9%, p &lt; 0.001). Subjects who viewed vaccines in general to have health-related risks were less willing to accept vaccination (aPR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.35-0.44). Moreover, participants who previously received an influenza vaccine were more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine (aPR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.31-1.58). Willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 increased as the self-perceived chances of contracting the infection increased (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: Overall, 53.1% of the study participants demonstrated willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19. We found several factors influencing the level of acceptance. Since vaccination appears to be an essential preventive measure that can halt the COVID-19 pandemic, factors relating to low vaccine acceptance need to be urgently addressed by public health strategies.","Alqudeimat, Yosor; Alenezi, Deema; AlHajri, Bedour; Alfouzan, Heba; Almokhaizeem, Zain; Altamimi, Saba; Almansouri, Waleed; Alzalzalah, Sayed; Ziyab, Ali H",,MEDLINE,,20210126.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000514636,covidwho-1040906,1423-0151,3,Med Princ Pract,en,CH,2021.0,"Med Princ Pract;30(3): 262-271, 2021.

"BACKGROUND: Home health care is a rapidly growing healthcare sector worldwide. Home health professionals face unique challenges related to preventing and controlling infections, which are likely to amplify during an infectious disease outbreak (e.g. SARS-CoV-2). Little is known about the current state of infection prevention and control-related policies and outbreak preparedness at U.S. home health agencies. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we conducted a national survey to assess infection prevention and control-related policies, infrastructure, and procedures prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Using a stratified random sample of 1506?U.S. home health agencies, we conducted a 61-item survey (paper and online) from November 9, 2018 to December 31, 2019. METHODS: Survey data were linked to publicly-available data on the quality of patient care, patient satisfaction, and other agency characteristics. Probability weights were developed to account for sample design and nonresponse; Pearson&#039;s &amp;#967;2, Fisher&#039;s exact, t-tests or linear regression were used to compare the universe of agencies/respondents and urban/rural agencies. RESULTS: 35.6% of agencies responded (n?=?536). Most home health personnel in charge of infection prevention and control have other responsibilities; one-third have no formal infection prevention and control training. Rural agencies are more likely to not have anyone in charge of infection prevention and control compared to those in urban areas. About 22% of agencies implement recommended guidelines when administering antibiotics. Less than a third (26.4%) report that their staff vaccination rates were higher than 95% during the last flu season. Only 48.1% of agencies accept patients requiring ventilation, and of those, 40.9% located in rural areas do not have specific infection prevention and control policies for ventilated patients, compared to 20.8% in urban areas (p?&lt;?0.001). Only 39.7% of agencies provide N95 respirators to their clinical staff; rural agencies are significantly more likely to provide those supplies than urban agencies (50.7% vs. 37.7%, p?=?0.004). Lastly, agencies report their greatest challenges with infection prevention and control are collecting/reporting infection data and adherence to/monitoring of nursing bag technique. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we found that infection prevention and control was suboptimal among U.S. home health care agencies. Consequently, most agencies have limited capacity to respond to infectious disease outbreaks. Staff and personal protective equipment shortages remain major concerns, and agencies will need to quickly adjust their existing infection prevention and control policies and potentially create new ones. In the long-term, agencies also need to improve influenza vaccination coverage among their staff.

"BACKGROUND: While the landscape of vaccine and treatment candidates against the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reviewed systematically, prophylactic candidates remain unexplored. OBJECTIVES: To map pre- and postexposure prophylactic (PrEP and PEP) candidate for COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: PubMed/Medline, Embase, International Committee of Medical Journal Editors and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform clinical trial registries and medRxiv. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND PARTICIPANTS: All studies in humans or animals and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in humans reporting primary data on prophylactic candidates against COVID-19, excluding studies focused on key populations. INTERVENTIONS: PrEP and PEP candidate for COVID-19. METHODS: Systematic review and qualitative synthesis of COVID-19 PrEP and PEP studies and RCTs complemented by search of medRxiv and PubMed and Embase for studies reporting RCT outcomes since systematic review search completion. RESULTS: We identified 13 studies (from 2119 database records) and 117 RCTs (from 5565 RCTs listed in the registries) that met the inclusion criteria. Non-RCT studies reported on cross-sectional studies using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in humans (n?=?2) or reported on animal studies (n?=?7), most of which used antibodies. All five completed RCTs focused on the use of HCQ as either PrEP or PEP, and these and the cross-sectional studies reported no prophylactic effect. The majority of ongoing RCTs evaluated HCQ or other existing candidates including non-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines, anti(retro)virals or use of vitamins and supplements. CONCLUSIONS: The key message from completed studies and RCTs seems to be that HCQ does not work. There is little evidence regarding other compounds, with all RCTs using candidates other than HCQ still ongoing. It remains to be seen if the portfolio of existing molecules being evaluated in RCTs will identify successful prophylaxis against COVID-19 or if there is a need for the development of new candidates.","Smit, Mikaela; Marinosci, Annalisa; Agoritsas, Thomas; Calmy, Alexandra",,MEDLINE,"Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Post-Exposure Prophylaxis; Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use; Antibodies, Neutralizing/therapeutic use; Antibodies, Viral/therapeutic use; Antimalarials/therapeutic use; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine/therapeutic use; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; Vaccines",20210120.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2021.01.013,covidwho-1032461,1469-0691,4,Clin Microbiol Infect,en,GB,2021.0,"Clin Microbiol Infect;27(4): 532-537, 2021 Apr.

"PURPOSE: This study determined the predictors of caregivers&#039; willingness to accept an accelerated regulatory process for the development of vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: An international cross-sectional survey was administered to 2557 caregivers of children in 17 pediatric emergency departments (EDs) across 6 countries from March 26, 2020, to June 30, 2020. Caregivers were asked to select 1 of 4 choices with which they most agreed regarding a proposed COVID-19 vaccine-approval process, in addition to questions regarding demographic characteristics, the ED visit, and attitudes about COVID-19. Univariate analyses were conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test for comparing non-normally distributed continuous variables, an independent t test for comparing normally distributed continuous variables, and a &amp;#967;2 or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used for determining independent factors associated with caregivers&#039; willingness to accept abridged development of a COVID-19 vaccine. A P value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant. FINDINGS: Almost half (1101/2557; 43%) of caregivers reported that they were willing to accept less rigorous testing and postresearch approval of a new COVID-19 vaccine. Independent factors associated with caregivers&#039; willingness to accept expedited COVID-19 vaccine research included having children who were up to date on the vaccination schedule (odds ratio [OR]?=?1.72; 95% CI, 1.29-2.31), caregivers&#039; concern about having had COVID-19 themselves at the time of survey completion in the ED (OR?=?1.1; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16), and caregivers&#039; intent to have their children vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine were to become available (OR?=?1.84; 95% CI, 1.54-2.21). Compared with fathers, mothers completing the survey were less likely to approve of changes in the vaccine-development process (OR?=?0.641; 95% CI, 0.529-0.775). IMPLICATIONS: Less than half of caregivers in this worldwide sample were willing to accept abbreviated COVID-19 vaccine testing. As a part of an effort to increase acceptance and uptake of a new vaccine, especially in order to protect children, public health strategies and individual providers should understand caregivers&#039; attitudes toward the approval of a vaccine and consult them appropriately.","Goldman, Ran D; Marneni, Shashidhar R; Seiler, Michelle; Brown, Julie C; Klein, Eileen J; Cotanda, Cristina Parra; Gelernter, Renana; Yan, Tyler D; Hoeffe, Julia; Davis, Adrienne L; Griffiths, Mark A; Hall, Jeanine E; Gualco, Gianluca; Mater, Ahmed; Manzano, Sergio; Thompson, Graham C; Ahmed, Sara; Ali, Samina; Shimizu, Naoki",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19 Vaccines; COVID-19; Caregivers; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Biomedical Research/standards; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; COVID-19/therapy; Caregivers/psychology; Caregivers/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Time Factors",20210114.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2020.09.012,covidwho-1023514,1879-114X,11,Clin Ther,en,US,2020.0,"Clin Ther;42(11): 2124-2133, 2020 11.

"BACKGROUND: This study attempts to understand coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine demand and hesitancy by assessing the public&#039;s vaccination intention and willingness-to-pay (WTP). Confidence in COVID-19 vaccines produced in China and preference for domestically-made or foreign-made vaccines was also investigated. METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional, self-administered online survey was conducted on 1-19 May 2020. The health belief model (HBM) was used as a theoretical framework for understanding COVID-19 vaccination intent and WTP. RESULTS: A total of 3,541 complete responses were received. The majority reported a probably yes intent (54.6%), followed by a definite yes intent (28.7%). The perception that vaccination decreases the chances of getting COVID-19 under the perceived benefit construct (OR = 3.14, 95% CI 2.05-4.83) and not being concerned about the efficacy of new COVID-19 vaccines under the perceived barriers construct (OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.31-2.09) were found to have the highest significant odds of a definite intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) of WTP for COVID-19 vaccine was CNY£¤200/US$28 (IQR CNY£¤100-500/USD$14-72). The highest marginal WTP for the vaccine was influenced by socio-economic factors. The majority were confident (48.7%) and completely confident (46.1%) in domestically-made COVID-19 vaccine. 64.2% reported a preference for a domestically-made over foreign-made COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate the utility of HBM constructs in understanding COVID-19 vaccination intent and WTP. It is important to improve health promotion and reduce the barriers to COVID-19 vaccination.","Lin, Yulan; Hu, Zhijian; Zhao, Qinjian; Alias, Haridah; Danaee, Mahmoud; Wong, Li Ping",,MEDLINE,COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Vaccination/psychology; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; COVID-19 Vaccines/economics; China/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Intention; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/psychology; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination/economics; Young Adult,20210114.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008961,covidwho-1024396,1935-2735,12,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,en,US,2020.0,"PLoS Negl Trop Dis;14(12): e0008961, 2020 12.

"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly instigated a global pandemic. Vaccine development is proceeding at an unprecedented pace. Once available, it will be important to maximize vaccine uptake and coverage. OBJECTIVE: To assess intent to be vaccinated against COVID-19 among a representative sample of adults in the United States and identify predictors of and reasons for vaccine hesitancy. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey, fielded from 16 through 20 April 2020. SETTING: Representative sample of adults residing in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Approximately 1000 adults drawn from the AmeriSpeak probability-based research panel, covering approximately 97% of the U.S. household population. MEASUREMENTS: Intent to be vaccinated against COVID-19 was measured with the question, &quot;When a vaccine for the coronavirus becomes available, will you get vaccinated?&quot; Response options were &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; and &quot;not sure.&quot; Participants who responded &quot;no&quot; or &quot;not sure&quot; were asked to provide a reason. RESULTS: A total of 991 AmeriSpeak panel members responded. Overall, 57.6% of participants (n?= 571) intended to be vaccinated, 31.6% (n?= 313) were not sure, and 10.8% (n?= 107) did not intend to be vaccinated. Factors independently associated with vaccine hesitancy (a response of &quot;no&quot; or &quot;not sure&quot;) included younger age, Black race, lower educational attainment, and not having received the influenza vaccine in the prior year. Reasons for vaccine hesitancy included vaccine-specific concerns, a need for more information, antivaccine attitudes or beliefs, and a lack of trust. LIMITATIONS: Participants&#039; intent to be vaccinated was explored before a vaccine was available and when the pandemic was affecting a narrower swath of the United States. Questions about specific information or factors that might increase vaccination acceptance were not included. The survey response rate was 16.1%. CONCLUSION: This national survey, conducted during the coronavirus pandemic, revealed that approximately 3 in 10 adults were not sure they would accept vaccination and 1 in 10 did not intend to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Targeted and multipronged efforts will be needed to increase acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine when one becomes available.

"BACKGROUND: The global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been mirrored by diffusion of misinformation and conspiracy theories about its origins (such as 5G cellular networks) and the motivations of preventive measures like vaccination, social distancing, and face masks (for example, as a political ploy). These beliefs have resulted in substantive, negative real-world outcomes but remain largely unstudied. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, online survey (n=660). Participants were asked about the believability of five selected COVID-19 narratives, their political orientation, their religious commitment, and their trust in science (a 21-item scale), along with sociodemographic items. Data were assessed descriptively, then latent profile analysis was used to identify subgroups with similar believability profiles. Bivariate (ANOVA) analyses were run, then multivariable, multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with membership in specific COVID-19 narrative believability profiles. RESULTS: For the full sample, believability of the narratives varied, from a low of 1.94 (SD=1.72) for the 5G narrative to a high of 5.56 (SD=1.64) for the zoonotic (scientific consensus) narrative. Four distinct belief profiles emerged, with the preponderance (70%) of the sample falling into Profile?1, which believed the scientifically accepted narrative (zoonotic origin) but not the misinformed or conspiratorial narratives. Other profiles did not disbelieve the zoonotic explanation, but rather believed additional misinformation to varying degrees. Controlling for sociodemographics, political orientation and religious commitment were marginally, and typically non-significantly, associated with COVID-19 belief profile membership. However, trust in science was a strong, significant predictor of profile membership, with lower trust being substantively associated with belonging to Profiles?2 through 4. CONCLUSIONS: Belief in misinformation or conspiratorial narratives may not be mutually exclusive from belief in the narrative reflecting scientific consensus; that is, profiles were distinguished not by belief in the zoonotic narrative, but rather by concomitant belief or disbelief in additional narratives. Additional, renewed dissemination of scientifically accepted narratives may not attenuate belief in misinformation. However, prophylaxis of COVID-19 misinformation might be achieved by taking concrete steps to improve trust in science and scientists, such as building understanding of the scientific process and supporting open science initiatives.","Agley, Jon; Xiao, Yunyu",,MEDLINE,Attitude to Health; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Communication; Politics; Religion; Trust; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Freedom; Humans; Internet; Latent Class Analysis; Logistic Models; Male; Masks; Multivariate Analysis; Physical Distancing; SARS-CoV-2; Science; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States; Vaccination; Young Adult,20210112.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-10103-x,covidwho-1015853,1471-2458,1,BMC Public Health,en,GB,2021.0,"BMC Public Health;21(1): 89, 2021 01 07.

"SARS-CoV-2 causes a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and significant mortality. Studies investigating underlying immune characteristics are needed to understand disease pathogenesis and inform vaccine design. In this study, we examined immune cell subsets in hospitalized and non-hospitalized individuals. In hospitalized patients, many adaptive and innate immune cells were decreased in frequency compared to healthy and convalescent individuals, with the exception of B lymphocytes which increased. Our findings show increased frequencies of T-cell activation markers (CD69, Ox40, HLA-DR and CD154) in hospitalized patients, with other T-cell activation/exhaustion markers (CD25, PD-L1 and TIGIT) remaining elevated in hospitalized and non-hospitalized individuals. B cells had a similar pattern of activation/exhaustion, with increased frequency of CD69 and CD95 during hospitalization, followed by an increase in PD1 frequencies in non-hospitalized individuals. Interestingly, many of these changes were found to increase over time in non-hospitalized longitudinal samples, suggesting a prolonged period of immune dysregulation following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Changes in T-cell activation/exhaustion in non-hospitalized patients were found to positively correlate with age. Severely infected individuals had increased expression of activation and exhaustion markers. These data suggest a prolonged period of immune dysregulation following SARS-CoV-2 infection highlighting the need for additional studies investigating immune dysregulation in convalescent individuals.","Files, Jacob K; Boppana, Sushma; Perez, Mildred D; Sarkar, Sanghita; Lowman, Kelsey E; Qin, Kai; Sterrett, Sarah; Carlin, Eric; Bansal, Anju; Sabbaj, Steffanie; Long, Dustin M; Kutsch, Olaf; Kobie, James; Goepfert, Paul; Erdmann, Nathaniel",,MEDLINE,"Antigens, Differentiation/immunology; B-Lymphocytes/immunology; COVID-19/immunology; Lymphocyte Activation; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; T-Lymphocytes/immunology; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; B-Lymphocytes/pathology; COVID-19/pathology; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; T-Lymphocytes/pathology",20210108.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1172/JCI140491,covidwho-1011051,1558-8238,1,J. clin. invest,en,US,2021.0,J Clin Invest;131(1)2021 01 04. ,Sustained cellular immune dysregulation in individuals recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection.,article,,,131
"OBJECTIVES: To study the percentage seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 to understand the pandemic status and predict the future situations in Ahmedabad. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTINGS: Field area of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. PARTICIPANTS: More than 30 000 individuals irrespective of their age, sex, acute/past COVID-19 infection participated in the serosurvey which covered all the 75 Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHCs) across 48 wards and 7 zones of the city. Study also involved healthcare workers (HCWs) from COVID-19/non-COVID-19 hospitals. INTERVENTIONS: Seropositivity of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was measured as a mark of COVID-19 infection. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Seropositivity was used to calculate cumulative incidence. Correlation of seropositivity with available demographic detail was used for valid and precise assessment of the pandemic situation. RESULTS: From 30 054 samples, the results were available for 29 891 samples and the crude seropositivity is 17.61%. For all the various age groups, the seropositivity calculated between 15% and 20%. The difference in seropositivity for both the sex group is statistically not significant. The seropositivity is significantly lower (13.64%) for HCWs as compared with non-HCWs (18.71%). Seropositivity shows increasing trend with time. Zone with maximum initial cases has high positivity as compared with other zones. UPHCs with recent rise in cases are leading in seropositivity as compared with earlier and widely affected UPHCs. CONCLUSIONS: The results of serosurveillance suggest that the population of Ahmedabad is still largely susceptible. People still need to follow preventive measures to protect themselves till an effective vaccine is available to the people at large. The data indicate the possibility of vanishing immunity over time and need further research to cross verify with scientific evidences.","Prakash, Om; Solanki, Bhavin; Sheth, Jay K; Joshi, Bhavin; Kadam, Mina; Vyas, Sheetal; Shukla, Aparajita; Tiwari, Hemant; Rathod, Sanjay; Rajput, Anil; Trivedi, Toral; Ramanuj, Vaibhav; Solanki, Anand",,MEDLINE,COVID-19/epidemiology; Health Personnel/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Immunoglobulin G/immunology; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; Urban Population; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Incidence; India/epidemiology; Male,20210108.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044101,covidwho-1011005,2044-6055,1,BMJ Open,en,GB,2021.0,"BMJ Open;11(1): e044101, 2021 01 05.

"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak forced cancer care providers to face different challenges in terms of prevention and treatment management due to specific precautions implemented for oncological patients. We aimed to describe the level of knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) among cancer patients, with the purpose to provide an image of the impact of COVID-19 and evaluate the effectiveness of pandemic response measures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We developed a cross-sectional multicentric study that targeted adults with active cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak, aiming to describe KAP related to COVID-19 among Romanian oncological patients. A questionnaire investigating 64 items on KAP related to the novel coronavirus was designed and applied in seven Romanian hospitals. The group of participants consisted of 1585 oncological patients who completed the questionnaire during the outbreak (April-May 2020). RESULTS: Only 172 patients (10.8%) had very good knowledge about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection symptoms, treatment options and incubation period. Only 44.3% of patients identified diarrhoea as a sign of COVID-19. About one-third of patients (32.6%) declared that they are &#039;very worried&#039; about getting infected with the novel coronavirus. More than two-thirds of participants (68%) considered that having cancer represents an additional risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2, but 27.8% would rather not vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2 should a vaccine be available. A small percentage (8.8%) believed that the risk of infection justifies delaying/stopping oncological treatment until after the pandemic. Around half of the participants (55.5%) declared being compliant with all the protective measures against coronavirus infection listed in the questionnaire. CONCLUSION: Romanian oncological patients have a less than expected knowledge about SARS-CoV-2, appropriate prevention behaviours, with limited trust in their efficacy, optimistic attitudes towards COVID-19 and low level of trust in information sources. Good COVID-19 knowledge was associated with appropriate practices towards COVID-19 and optimistic attitudes.","Gheorghe, A S; Negru, S M; Ni¨¨?ipir, C; Mazilu, L; Marinca, M; Gafton, B; Ciuleanu, T E; Schenker, M; Dragomir, R D; Gheorghe, A D; Stovicek, P O; Bandi-Vasilica, M; Bo¨¨?, A C; Mihaila, R I; Zob, D L; Kajanto, A L; Stanculeanu, D L",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Medical Oncology/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Neoplasms/therapy; Surveys and Questionnaires; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; COVID-19/epidemiology; COVID-19/virology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Male; Medical Oncology/methods; Middle Aged; Neoplasms/diagnosis; Pandemics; Romania/epidemiology; SARS-CoV-2/isolation &amp;amp; purification; SARS-CoV-2/physiology; Young Adult",20210107.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2020.100027,covidwho-1007936,2059-7029,1,ESMO Open,en,GB,2021.0,"ESMO Open;6(1): 100027, 2021 02.

"BACKGROUND: While administration of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR-II?) vaccine has been effective at preventing rubella infection in the United States, the durability of humoral immunity to the rubella component of MMR vaccine has not been widely studied among older adolescents and adults. METHODS: In this longitudinal study, we sought to assess the durability of rubella virus (RV)-specific humoral immunity in a healthy population (n?=?98) of adolescents and young adults at two timepoints: ~7 and ~17?years after two doses of MMR-II? vaccination. Levels of circulating antibodies specific to RV were measured by ELISA and an immune-colorimetric neutralization assay. RV-specific memory B cell responses were also measured by ELISpot. RESULTS: Rubella-specific IgG antibody titers, neutralizing antibody titers, and memory B cell responses declined with increasing time since vaccination; however, these decreases were relatively moderate. Memory B cell responses exhibited a greater decline in men compared to women. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, rubella-specific humoral immunity declines following vaccination, although subjects&#039; antibody titers remain well above the currently recognized threshold for protective immunity.

"OBJECTIVE: To explore parents&#039; and guardians&#039; views and experiences of accessing National Health Service (NHS) general practices for routine childhood vaccinations during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in England. DESIGN: Mixed methods approach involving an online cross-sectional survey (conducted between 19th April and 11th May 2020) and semi-structured telephone interviews (conducted between 27th April and 27th May 2020). PARTICIPANTS: 1252 parents and guardians (aged 16+ years) who reported living in England with a child aged 18 months or under completed the survey. Nineteen survey respondents took part in follow-up interviews. RESULTS: The majority of survey respondents (85.7%) considered it important for their children to receive routine vaccinations on schedule during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, several barriers to vaccination were identified. These included a lack of clarity around whether vaccination services were operating as usual, particularly amongst respondents from lower income households and those self-reporting as Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity; difficulties in organising vaccination appointments; and fears around contracting COVID-19 while attending general practice. Concerns about catching COVID-19 while accessing general practice were weighed against concerns about children acquiring a vaccine-preventable disease if they did not receive scheduled routine childhood vaccinations. Many parents and guardians felt their child&#039;s risk of acquiring a vaccine-preventable disease was low as the implementation of stringent physical distancing measures (from March 23rd 2020) meant they were not mixing with others. CONCLUSION: To promote routine childhood vaccination uptake during the current COVID-19 outbreak, further waves of COVID-19 infection, and future pandemics, prompt and sustained national and general practice level communication is needed to raise awareness of vaccination service continuation and the importance of timely vaccination, and invitation-reminder systems for vaccination need to be maintained. To allay concerns about the safety of accessing general practice, practices should communicate the measures being implemented to prevent COVID-19 transmission.","Bell, Sadie; Clarke, Richard; Paterson, Pauline; Mounier-Jack, Sandra",,MEDLINE,COVID-19/immunology; Legal Guardians/psychology; Pandemics/prevention &amp;amp; control; Parents/psychology; Vaccination/psychology; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; England; Female; Humans; Immunization/psychology; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult,20210104.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244049,covidwho-999828,1932-6203,12,PLoS One,en,US,2020.0,"PLoS One;15(12): e0244049, 2020.

"OBJECTIVES: To plan for coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine distribution, the Indiana Department of Health surveyed nursing home and assisted living facility staff. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of an anonymous survey sent via text message link to personal cell phones and emails. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home and assisted living facility staff in Indiana. MEASURES: Staff characteristics including age, gender, race, ethnicity, role in the facility, experience in long-term care, and geographic location of facility were self-reported along with prior infection and willingness to receive an approved vaccine as soon as it is available. Responses were weighted to represent staff statewide. Weighted frequencies and logit regression estimated characteristics associated with vaccine willingness. RESULTS: There were 8,243 responses to the survey. For nursing home staff (survey delivered via 23,232 working phone numbers), there was a 33% response rate). There were 2,372 (29%) in nurse aide or similar roles and 1,602 nurses providing direct clinical care (19%). Overall, 45% of respondents indicated they would receive an approved COVID-19 vaccine as soon as available. Of those unwilling to take the vaccine when first available, 44% would consider in the future. Concerns about side effects was the primary reason for vaccine hesitancy (70%). Characteristics associated with increased willingness were age over 60, male, and white race (P &lt; .0001). No statistically significant differences were observed among staff self-reporting prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine immediately or in the future may be as high as 69%, but varies among subgroups of nursing home staff which has implications for distribution. Educating staff on the vaccine may be critical for increasing uptake. Widespread vaccination holds the promise of protection against serious illness and death and a return of visitors and activities that support improved quality of life. This promise will not be realized without strong uptake of the vaccines.","Unroe, Kathleen T; Evans, Russell; Weaver, Lindsay; Rusyniak, Dan; Blackburn, Justin",,MEDLINE,COVID-19 Vaccines/therapeutic use; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Nursing Homes; Nursing Staff/psychology; Vaccination/psychology; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Homes for the Aged; Humans; Indiana; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Diseases/prevention &amp;amp; control; Occupational Diseases/virology; SARS-CoV-2; Young Adult,20210104.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17022,covidwho-999017,1532-5415,3,J Am Geriatr Soc,en,US,2021.0,"J Am Geriatr Soc;69(3): 593-599, 2021 03.

"BACKGROUND: As the Coronavirus pandemic continues to spread across the globe, the world continues in its search for a medication to cure, or attenuate, the symptoms of COVID-19. It would be desirable, and fortuitous, to identify such a medication that is already in use for another condition, and whose side effect profile and safety data are already known and approved. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the current study was to evaluate the influence of medication on typical COVID-19 symptoms, using data from an online surveillance survey in Germany. METHODS: Between early April and late July 2020, 3990 people in Lower Saxony, Germany, participated in an online symptom tracker application, &#039;&quot;covid-nein-danke.de&quot;. The questionnaire contained items on typical COVID-19 symptoms, age range, gender, work in patient-facing healthcare, community life, postal code, previous illnesses, permanent medication, vaccination status, and results of PCR and antibody testing for COVID-19, and COVID-19 treatment if performed. RESULTS: Analysis of the data demonstrated a statistically significant inverse relationship between self-reported typical COVID-19 symptoms and self-reported statin therapy and, to a lesser extent, antihypertensive therapy. Defining COVID-19 by restrictive symptom criteria (4 out of 7 symptoms) or a positive PCR-test the association was found solely for statins with a statistically significance (OR 0.28 (0.1 - 0.78)). CONCLUSIONS: People taking statin medication may be more likely to have an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, in which case they may be at an increased risk of transmitting it unknowingly. The results of this study should be incorporated into &#039;symptoms-based&#039; surveillance and decision-making protocols in respect to COVID-19. Whether statin therapy has a beneficial effect in combating COVID-19 cannot be deduced from the data and should be investigated by further study.

"BACKGROUND: Until now, no vaccine or effective drug is available for the control, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19. Preventive measures are the only ways to be protected from the disease and knowledge of the people about the preventive measures is a vital matter. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the knowledge of the general people in Rajshahi district, Bangladesh regarding the COVID-19 preventive measures. METHODOLOGY: This cross sectional study was conducted from March 10 to April 25, 2020. Data were collected with a semi-structured questionnaire from 436 adult respondents selected by using a mixed sampling technique. Frequency analysis, chi-square test, and logistic regression model were utilized in this study. SPSS (IBM, Version 22) was used for data analysis. 95% confidence interval and p-value = 0.05 were accepted for statistical significance. RESULTS: Only 21.6% of the respondents had good knowledge of the COVID-19 preventive measures. The highest 67.2% of them knew that washing hands with soap could prevent the disease, but contrarily, the highest 72.5% did not know that avoidance of touching mouth, nose, and eyes without washing hands was a preventive measure. Only 28.4% and 36.9% of the respondents knew that maintaining physical distancing and avoiding mass gatherings were measures of prevention of COVID-19 respectively. The younger age (&amp;#8804;25 years), low family income (&amp;#8804;15,000 Bangladeshi Taka (BDT), occupation others than business and service, and nuclear family had the lower odds of having no/less knowledge about the preventive measures. CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge level of the general people regarding prevention of COVID-19 was alarmingly low in Bangladesh. The government of Bangladesh, health policy makers and donor agencies should consider the findings and take immediate steps for improving knowledge of the public about prevention of the disease.","Rana, Md Masud; Karim, Md Reazul; Wadood, Md Abdul; Kabir, Md Mahbubul; Alam, Md Mahidul; Yeasmin, Farhana; Islam, Md Rafiqul",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/epidemiology; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Bangladesh/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Young Adult",20201214.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243410,covidwho-968899,1932-6203,12,PLoS One,en,US,2020.0,"PLoS One;15(12): e0243410, 2020.

"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 global pandemic has disrupted the lives of millions and forced countries to devise public health policies to reduce the pace of transmission. In the Middle East and North Africa, falling oil prices, disparities in wealth and public health infrastructure, and large refugee populations have significantly increased the COVID-19 disease burden. In light of these exacerbating factors, public health surveillance is particularly necessary to help leaders understand and implement effective disease control policies to reduce Sars-CoV-2 persistence and transmission. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to provide advanced surveillance metrics, in combination with traditional surveillance, for COVID-19 transmission that account for weekly shifts in the pandemic speed, acceleration, jerk and persistence, to better understand country risk for explosive growth and to better inform those who are managing the pandemic. Existing surveillance coupled with our dynamic metrics of transmission will inform health policy to control the COVID-19 pandemic until an effective vaccine is developed. METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 30 days of COVID-19 data from public health registries. We use an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in the Middle East and North Africa as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel data model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments (GMM) approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: The regression Wald statistic is significant (&amp;#967;^2 (5)=859.5, P&lt;.001). The Sargan test is not significant, failing to reject the validity of over identifying restrictions (&amp;#967;^2 (294)= 16 P=.99). Countries with the highest cumulative caseload of the novel coronavirus include Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Israel with 530,380, 426,634, 342,202, and 303,109 cases respectively. Many of the smaller countries in MENA have higher infection rates than those countries with the highest caseloads. Oman has 33.3 new infections per 100,000 population while Bahrain has 12.1, Libya has 14, and Lebanon has 14.6. In order of most to least number of cumulative deaths since January 2020, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia have 30,375, 10,254, 6,120, and 5,185 respectively. Israel, Bahrain, Lebanon, and Oman had the highest rates of COVID-19 persistence which are the number of new infections statistically related to new infections 7 days ago. Bahrain had positive speed, acceleration and jerk signaling the potential for explosive growth. CONCLUSIONS: Static and dynamic public health surveillance metrics provide a more complete picture of pandemic progression across countries in MENA. Static measures capture data at a given point in time such as infection rates and death rates. By including speed, acceleration, jerk, and 7-day persistence, public health officials may design policy with an eye to the future. Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Israel all demonstrated the highest rate of infections, acceleration, jerk, and 7-day persistence rates prompting public health leaders to increase prevention efforts.","Post, Lori; Marogi, Emily; Moss, Charles B; Murphy, Robert Leo; Ison, Michael G; Achenbach, Chad J; Resnick, Danielle; Singh, Lauren; White, Janine; Oehmke, James Francis",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/epidemiology; Africa, Northern/epidemiology; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Middle East/epidemiology; Pandemics; Public Health Surveillance/methods; SARS-CoV-2/isolation &amp;amp; purification",20201214.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/25830,covidwho-968790,1438-8871,1,J Med Internet Res,en,CA,2021.0,"J Med Internet Res;23(1): e25830, 2021 01 15.

"The COVID-19 pandemic, which was reported in early January 2020 in China and spread rapidly around the globe, will certainly remain as one of the most impactful disruptive events of the 21st century. To contain the spread of the virus while awaiting a vaccine, countries applied different approaches from simply giving advice on personal hygiene and applying progressive measures to total lockdown. This paper aims to investigate the impacts of the pandemic on travel behavior in Istanbul, Turkey, through a longitudinal panel study conducted in three phases during the early stages of the epidemic and pandemic. The paper reflects the travel behavior evolution during the development of the outbreak resulting from residents&#039; self- regulation and governmental measures, distinguishing travel for commute, Social/Recreational/Leisure (SRL), and shopping activities, as well as use of different travel modes based on various socio-economic characteristics. Due to the application of the social distancing of at least 1.5a?¡¥m, closure of numerous non-essential venues, encouraging teleworking and distance education, job losses and cancellation of all social gatherings in Istanbul between the second and third phase of our data collection, the transition in travel activity pattern and transport mobility appears to be quite extreme, particularly for commuting and SRL trips.","Shakibaei, Shahin; de Jong, Gerard C; Alpk?kin, Pelin; Rashidi, Taha H",,MEDLINE,,20201214.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2020.102619,covidwho-969276,2210-6715,,Sustain Cities Soc,en,NL,2021.0,"Sustain Cities Soc;65: 102619, 2021 Feb.

"INTRODUCTION: Vaccines against COVID-19 have been developed in unprecedented time. However, the effectiveness of any vaccine is dictated by the proportion of the population willing to be vaccinated. In this observational population-based study we examined intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 over the course of the pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of 7,547 US adults enrolled in the Understanding America Study (UAS). Participants reporting being willing, undecided and unwilling to get vaccinated against coronavirus across 13 assessments conducted from April-October, 2020. Public attitudes to vaccination against the coronavirus were also assessed. RESULTS: Willingness to vaccinate declined from 71% in April to 53.6% in October. This was explained by an increase in the percentage of participants undecided about vaccinating (from 10.5% to 14.4%) and the portion of the sample unwilling to vaccinate (from 18.5% to 32%). The population subgroups most likely to be undecided/unwilling to vaccinate were those without a degree (undecided: RRR=2.47, 95% CI: 2.04-3.00; unwilling: RRR=1.92, 95% CI: 1.67-2.20), Black participants (undecided: RRR=2.18, 95% CI: 1.73-2.74; unwilling: RRR=1.98, 95% CI: 1.63-2.42), and females (undecided: RRR=1.41, 95% CI: 1.20-1.65; unwilling: RRR=1.29, 95% CI: 1.14-1.46). Those aged 65+, those on high incomes, and other race/ethnicity participants were least likely to be undecided or unwilling to vaccinate. Concerns about potential side effects of a vaccine were common.

"Background: Vaccine hesitancy is a potential threat to global public health. Since there is an unprecedented global effort to develop a vaccine against the COVID-19 pandemic, much less is known about its acceptance in the community. Understanding key determinants that influence the preferences and demands of a future vaccine by the community may help to develop strategies for improving the global vaccination program. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine and their determinants among people in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted using snowball sampling strategy under a highly restricted environment. A bilingual, self-administered anonymous questionnaire was designed and sent to?the?study participants through social media plat-forms and email. Study participants were recruited across the country, including the four major cities?(Riyadh, Dammam, Jeddah, and Abha)?in Saudi Arabia. Key determinants that predict vaccine acceptance among respondents were modelled using logistic regression analysis. Of the 1000 survey invitees, 992 responded to the survey. Results: Of the 992 respondents, 642 showed interest to accept the COVID-19 vaccine if it is available. Willingness to accept the future COVID-19 vaccine is relatively high among older age groups, being married participants with education level postgraduate degree or higher (68.8%), non-Saudi (69.1%), employed in government sector (68.9%). In multivariate model, respondents who were above 45 years (aOR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.08-3.21) and married (aOR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.28-2.50) were significantly associated with vaccine acceptance (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Addressing sociodemographic determinants relating to the COVID-19 vaccination may help to increase uptake of the global vaccination program to tackle future pandemics.

"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the Greek general population toward coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the lockdown period in April 2020, to examine factors associated with misperceptions and to determine behavioral patterns that may require interventions. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of the general Greek population (N = 1858) was conducted. A geographically stratified cluster sampling was implemented. A questionnaire was composed consisting of 35 questions. Data collection took place from 15 April to 2 May 2020. A random-digit dialing survey was conducted by 29 interviewers. RESULTS: The majority of respondents (62.7%) answered &amp;#8805;12/17 questions correctly. Participants aged 18-44 years, male gender, specific occupations (freelancer, unemployed, housewife, retiree) and those who sought information about COVID-19 from less than two sources received lower aggregated scores on knowledge questions. Regarding attitudes toward future vaccination, 18.9% declared that were against it, while 81.1% that they may consider or will be vaccinated. About 40% were not using a face mask and only 42% washed their hands appropriately. CONCLUSION: Adjusting information campaigns targeting especially people below 45 years of age can help to sensitize them and realise their role to control the spread. Further targeted surveys are needed to adjust/design prevention campaigns.","Mouchtouri, Varvara A; Agathagelidou, Evagelia; Kofonikolas, Kleovoulos; Rousou, Xanthi; Dadouli, Katerina; Pinaka, Ourania; Agathocleous, Evi; Anagnostopoulou, Lemonia; Chatziligou, Chrysanthi; Christoforidou, Eleni P; Chalntoupi, Thekla; Kalomoiris, Loukas; Kapoula, Christina; Kokkinou, Vasiliki; Constantinides, Aggeliki; Konstantinou, Petros; Kostara, Elina; Kourentis, Leonidas; Lantou, Anastasia; Lempidakis, Georgios; Liasidi, Polixeni-Natalia; Michalakis, Christos; Panagiotou, Dorothea; Panteliadou, Freideriki; Papadoulis, Vasileios; Papantoniou, Grigorios; Psatha, Maria; Ragias, Dimitrios; Ringa, Vera; Syrakouli, Argyro; Skoutari, Angeliki; Stergiadou, Stella; Theodorou, Andreas; Tzika, Vasiliki; Lagiou, Areti; Dardavesis, Theodoros; Prezerakos, Panagiotis; Hadjichristodoulou, Christos",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Communicable Disease Control/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Greece; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",20201202.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17238854,covidwho-948965,1660-4601,23,Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),en,CH,2020.0,Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(23)2020 11 28. ,"Nationwide Survey in Greece about Knowledge, Risk Perceptions, and Preventive Behaviors for COVID-19 during the General Lockdown in April 2020.",article,,,17
"The last 2019/20 northern hemisphere influenza season overlapped with the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Italy was the first western country where severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread to a significant extent. In this representative cross-sectional survey, we aimed to describe some opinions and attitudes of the Italian general population towards both influenza vaccination and the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify potential modifiers of the decision-making process regarding the uptake of the 2020/21 influenza vaccine. A total of 2543 responses were analyzed. Although most (74.8%) participants valued influenza vaccination positively and declared that it should be mandatory, some misconceptions around influenza persist. The general practitioner was the main source of trusted information on influenza vaccines, while social networks were judged to be the least reliable. Younger and less affluent individuals, subjects not vaccinated in the previous season, and those living in smaller communities showed lower odds of receiving the 2020/21 season influenza vaccination. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may have positively influenced the propensity of being vaccinated against 2020/21 seasonal influenza. In order to increase influenza vaccination coverage rates multidisciplinary targeted interventions are needed. The role of general practitioners remains crucial in increasing influenza vaccine awareness and acceptance by effective counselling.","Domnich, Alexander; Cambiaggi, Maura; Vasco, Alessandro; Maraniello, Luca; Ansaldi, Filippo; Baldo, Vincenzo; Bonanni, Paolo; Calabr¨°, Giovanna Elisa; Costantino, Claudio; de Waure, Chiara; Gabutti, Giovanni; Restivo, Vincenzo; Rizzo, Caterina; Vitale, Francesco; Grassi, Riccardo",,MEDLINE,,20201202.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8040711,covidwho-948863,2076-393X,4,,en,CH,2020.0,Vaccines (Basel);8(4)2020 Nov 30. ,Attitudes and Beliefs on Influenza Vaccination during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results from a Representative Italian Survey.,article,,,8
"INTRODUCTION: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic and identified as a priority target group for COVID-19 vaccines. We aimed to determine COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate in HCWs people in France. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous survey from the March 26th to July 2nd 2020. Primary endpoint was the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine was available. RESULTS: Two thousand and forty-seven HCWs answered the survey; women accounted for 74% of respondents. Among respondents, 1.554 (76.9%, 95 %CI 75.1-78.9) would accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Older age, male gender, fear about COVID-19, individual perceived risk and flu vaccination during previous season were associated with hypothetic COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Nurses and assistant nurses were less prone to get vaccinated against COVID-19 than physicians. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with a decrease in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Flu vaccine rate was 57.3 % during the previous season, and 54.6 % of the respondents had intention to get flu vaccine during the next season. CONCLUSIONS: Intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 reached 75% in HCWs with discrepancies between occupational categories.

"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an unprecedented disruption in medical education and healthcare systems worldwide. The disease can cause life-threatening conditions and it presents challenges for medical education, as instructors must deliver lectures safely, while ensuring the integrity and continuity of the medical education process. It is therefore important to assess the usability of online learning methods, and to determine their feasibility and adequacy for medical students. We aimed to provide an overview of the situation experienced by medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of medical students regarding electronic medical education. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with medical students from more than 13 medical schools in Libya. A paper-based and online survey was conducted using email and social media. The survey requested demographic and socioeconomic information, as well as information related to medical online learning and electronic devices; medical education status during the COVID-19 pandemic; mental health assessments; and e-learning knowledge, attitudes, and practices. A total of 3,348 valid questionnaires were retrieved. Most respondents (64.7%) disagreed that e-learning could be implemented easily in Libya. While 54.1% of the respondents agreed that interactive discussion is achievable by means of e-learning. However, only 21.1% agreed that e-learning could be used for clinical aspects, as compared with 54.8% who disagreed with this statement and 24% who were neutral. Only 27.7% of the respondents had participated in online medical educational programs during the COVID-19 pandemic, while 65% reported using the internet for participating in study groups and discussions. There is no vaccine for COVID-19 yet. As such, the pandemic will undeniably continue to disrupt medical education and training. As we face the prospect of a second wave of virus transmission, we must take certain measures and make changes to minimize the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on medical education and on the progression of training. The time for change is now, and there should be support and enthusiasm for providing valid solutions to reduce this disruption, such as online training and virtual clinical experience. These measures could then be followed by hands-on experience that is provided in a safe environment.","Alsoufi, Ahmed; Alsuyihili, Ali; Msherghi, Ahmed; Elhadi, Ahmed; Atiyah, Hana; Ashini, Aimen; Ashwieb, Arwa; Ghula, Mohamed; Ben Hasan, Hayat; Abudabuos, Salsabil; Alameen, Hind; Abokhdhir, Taqwa; Anaiba, Mohamed; Nagib, Taha; Shuwayyah, Anshirah; Benothman, Rema; Arrefae, Ghalea; Alkhwayildi, Abdulwajid; Alhadi, Abdulmueti; Zaid, Ahmed; Elhadi, Muhammed",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/epidemiology; Education, Distance/methods; Education, Medical, Undergraduate/methods; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Students, Medical/psychology; Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; COVID-19/virology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Learning; Libya/epidemiology; Male; Quarantine/methods; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",20201130.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242905,covidwho-945354,1932-6203,11,PLoS One,en,US,2020.0,"PLoS One;15(11): e0242905, 2020.

"To investigate factors associated with intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19 we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1,500 UK adults, recruited from an existing online research panel. Data were collected between 14th and 17th July 2020. We used linear regression analyses to investigate associations between intention to be vaccinated for COVID-19 &quot;when a vaccine becomes available to you&quot; and sociodemographic factors, previous influenza vaccination, general vaccine attitudes and beliefs, attitudes and beliefs about COVID-19, and attitudes and beliefs about a COVID-19 vaccination. 64% of participants reported being very likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19, 27% were unsure, and 9% reported being very unlikely to be vaccinated. Personal and clinical characteristics, previous influenza vaccination, general vaccination beliefs, and beliefs and attitudes about COVID-19 and a COVID-19 vaccination explained 76% of the variance in vaccination intention. Intention to be vaccinated was associated with more positive general COVID-19 vaccination beliefs and attitudes, weaker beliefs that the vaccination would cause side effects or be unsafe, greater perceived information sufficiency to make an informed decision about COVID-19 vaccination, greater perceived risk of COVID-19 to others (but not risk to oneself), older age, and having been vaccinated for influenza last winter (2019/20). Despite uncertainty around the details of a COVID-19 vaccination, most participants reported intending to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Actual uptake may be lower. Vaccination intention reflects general vaccine beliefs and attitudes. Campaigns and messaging about a COVID-19 vaccination could consider emphasizing the risk of COVID-19 to others and necessity for everyone to be vaccinated.","Sherman, Susan M; Smith, Louise E; Sim, Julius; Aml?t, Richard; Cutts, Megan; Dasch, Hannah; Rubin, G James; Sevdalis, Nick",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Intention; Vaccination/psychology; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Influenza Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom",20201130.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1846397,covidwho-944145,2164-554X,6,Hum Vaccin Immunother,en,US,2021.0,"Hum Vaccin Immunother;17(6): 1612-1621, 2021 06 03.

"INTRODUCTION: The severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 20 million people worldwide, and the spread is most prevalent in the USA, where California had accounted over 240,000 cases in the initial 5?months of the pandemic. To estimate the number of infected persons in our community, we conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This cross-sectional study evaluated the presence of immunoglobulin G, antibody for SARS-CoV-2 during the time period of July 15, 2020, to July 27, 2020. Testing was done on serum samples from patients who had visited affiliated outpatient clinics or our emergency department. Additionally, we collected age, gender, ethnicity, race, and location of testing. RESULTS: Eight hundred sixty-five tests were included in the study. The outpatient clinics cohort accounted for 56% of results and emergency department (ED) contributed 44%. The positive percentage of SARS-CoV-2 test was 9.4% (95% CI: 0.08-0.12). The positivity rates of the outpatient (5.6%) and ED (14.2%) setting differed. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was greatest in those that identified as Hispanic/Latino, 18.1% versus 13.4% in other groups. Specifically compared to the non-Hispanic/Latino population, the prevalence was significantly higher, with a relative risk of 2.73 (95% CI: 1.8-4.1), p &lt; 0.0001. CONCLUSION: The low antibody positivity rate in the community indicates the need for a vaccine. The Hispanic/Latino patient population should be considered for increased education on preventing transmission and acquisition of COVID-19 as well as being considered as a priority for vaccination once a vaccine is available.","Yamaki, Jason; Peled, Harry; Mathews, Sajen; Park, David; Firoozi, Mina; Smith, Kim; Nguyen, Lee",,MEDLINE,,20201127.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40615-020-00918-0,covidwho-940972,2196-8837,,J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),en,CH,2020.0,J Racial Ethn Health Disparities;2020 Nov 23. ,"Seroprevalence of Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 at a Community Hospital Emergency Department and Outpatient Laboratory in Northern Orange County, California.",article,,,
"Background: Racial disparities in influenza vaccination among underserved minority older adults are a public health problem. Understanding the factors that impact influenza vaccination behaviors among underserved older African-Americans could lead to more effective communication and delivery strategies. Aims: We aimed to investigate rate and factors associated with seasonal influenza vaccination among underserved African-American older adults. We were particularly interested in the roles of demographic factors, socioeconomic status, and continuity and patient satisfaction with medical care, as well as physical and mental health status. Methods: This community-based cross-sectional study recruited 620 African-American older adults residing in South Los Angeles, one of the most under-resources areas within Los Angeles County, with a population of over one million. Bivariate and multiple regression analyses were performed to document independent correlates of influenza vaccination. Results: One out of three underserved African-American older adults aged 65 years and older residing in South Los Angeles had never been vaccinated against the influenza. Only 49% of participants reported being vaccinated within the 12 months prior to the interview. One out of five participants admitted that their health care provider recommended influenza vaccination. However, only 45% followed their provider&#039;s recommendations. Multivariate logistic regression shows that old-old (&amp;#8805;75 years), participants who lived alone, those with a lower level of continuity of care and satisfaction with the accessibility, availability, and quality of care, and participants with a higher number of depression symptoms were less likely to be vaccinated. As expected, participants who indicated that their physician had advised them to obtain a flu vaccination were more likely to be vaccinated. Our data shows that only gender was associated with self-report of being advised to have a flu shot. Discussion. One of the most striking aspects of this study is that no association between influenza vaccination and being diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other major chronic condition was detected. Our study confirmed that both continuity of care and satisfaction with access, availability, and quality of medical care are strongly associated with current influenza vaccinations. We documented that participants with a higher number of depression symptoms were less likely to be vaccinated. Conclusion: These findings highlight the role that culturally acceptable and accessible usual source of care van play as a gatekeeper to facilitate and implement flu vaccination among underserved minority older adults. Consistent disparities in influenza vaccine uptake among underserved African-American older adults, coupled with a disproportionate burden of chronic diseases, places them at high risk for undesired outcomes associated with influenza. As depression is more chronic/disabling and is less likely to be treated in African-Americans, there is a need to screen and treat depression as a strategy to enhance preventive care management such as vaccination of underserved African-American older adults. Quantification of associations between lower vaccine uptake and both depression symptoms as well as living alone should enable health professionals target underserved African-American older adults who are isolated and suffer from depression to reduce vaccine-related inequalities.","Bazargan, Mohsen; Wisseh, Cheryl; Adinkrah, Edward; Ameli, Hoorolnesa; Santana, Delia; Cobb, Sharon; Assari, Shervin",,MEDLINE,"African Americans/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Influenza Vaccines; Vaccination/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Influenza, Human/prevention &amp;amp; control; Logistic Models; Los Angeles; Male; Medically Underserved Area; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Patient Satisfaction; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/epidemiology; Socioeconomic Factors; Vaccination/psychology",20201125.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/2160894,covidwho-939924,2314-6141,,Biomed Res Int,en,US,2020.0,"Biomed Res Int;2020: 2160894, 2020.

"The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out during the peak season of influenza in China. We aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of influenza among Chinese adults during this special season. A cross-sectional online questionnaire survey was performed by recruiting 4822 participants. There were 76.09% of the participants reporting that they learned more knowledge of influenza during the COVID-19 epidemic. The mean knowledge score of participants was 5.51?¡À?1.55 (78.7% correct rate), and participants who received influenza vaccination in the past year scored the highest (6.06?¡À?1.30, p&lt;?.001). Nearly half of the participants (49.63%) agreed the threat to the functioning of society by influenza was far less than the COVID-19. 73.04% of the participants knew influenza vaccination was the most effective way to prevent influenza infection, while 54.18% did not know the vaccination location. The proportion of participants who were willing to get vaccinated would increase from 62.53% to 85.82% if clinicians recommended the vaccination. For influenza-like illness, merely 36.11% of participants would seek medical care from the hospital, and 60.53% agreed or showed a neutral attitude toward antibiotic use for influenza treatment. Regression analyses showed that the medical profession and history of influenza vaccination were both associated with higher knowledge or attitude score and participants&#039; use of face masks in previous seasons and their willingness to receive influenza vaccination. In conclusion, the awareness of influenza vaccination among adults in China should be reinforced and educational campaigns were warranted to increase the coverage of influenza vaccination.","Jiang, Minghuan; Feng, Liuxin; Wang, Weihua; Gong, Yilin; Ming, Wai-Kit; Hayat, Khezar; Li, Pengchao; Gillani, Ali Hassan; Yao, Xuelin; Fang, Yu",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/epidemiology; Health Education; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human/prevention &amp;amp; control; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination/psychology; Adolescent; Adult; China/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Influenza, Human/epidemiology; Male; SARS-CoV-2; Young Adult",20201125.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1812312,covidwho-939536,2164-554X,5,Hum Vaccin Immunother,en,US,2021.0,"Hum Vaccin Immunother;17(5): 1412-1419, 2021 05 04.

"Worldwide, leaders are implementing nonpharmaceutical interventions to slow transmission of the novel coronavirus while pursuing vaccines that confer immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In this paper, we will describe lessons learned from past pandemics and vaccine campaigns about the path to successful vaccine delivery. The historical record suggests that to have a widely immunized population, leaders must invest in evidence-based vaccine delivery strategies that generate demand, allocate and distribute vaccines, and verify coverage. To generate demand, we must understand the roots of vaccine hesitancy, engage trusted sources of authority to advocate for vaccination, and commit to longitudinal engagement with communities. To allocate vaccines, we must allow qualified organizations and expert coalitions to determine evidence-based vaccination approaches and generate the political will to ensure the cooperation of local and national governments. To distribute vaccines, we must ensure that the people and organizations with expertise in manufacturing, supply chains, and last-mile distribution are positioned to direct efforts. To verify vaccine coverage, we must identify vaccination tracking systems that are portable, interoperable, and secure. Lessons of past pandemics suggest that nations should invest in evidence-informed strategies to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines protect individuals, suppress transmission, and minimize disruption to health services and livelihoods.

"BACKGROUND: Health care workers are at greater risk of infection during COVID 19 pandemic.? This study was carried out to assess the knowledge and attitude toward COVID-19 among healthcare workers at working at Seti Zonal Hospital. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed between April and May 2020 at Seti Zonal Hospital with purposive sampling technique and self-administered questionnaire of the knowledge and attitude of healthcare workers regarding COVID-19. The demographic characteristics mean knowledge and attitude score of healthcare workers were identified and inferential statistics t-test, ANOVA and Spearman&#039;s correlation were used to show the relationship between variables. RESULTS: A total of 230 healthcare workers (92% response rate) had a mean score of knowledge and attitude of 8¡À0.88 and 7.88¡À1.32, respectively with good knowledge and a low positive attitude. Majority (94.7%) were familiar with the sign and symptoms, agreed that chronic diseases patients and HCWs are at a higher risk (97%) and (87.8%) respectively while knowledge related to COVID 19 vaccination, isolation period and treatment by antibiotics was poor with low positive attitude towards information availability about COVID 19 (41%), government ability to control the epidemic (49%), and the family members might get infection (60%). There was a positive correlation between knowledge scores and attitude scores (r=0.28, p&lt;0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We identified a significant gap in information source, sufficient knowledge and low positive attitude about COVID 19 among health care workers. Greater educational efforts about prevention should be directed to different level of health workers.","Parajuli, Janaki; Mishra, Pradip; Sharma, Seema; Bohora, Krishna Bahadur; Rathour, Pratiksha Singh; Joshi, Jagadish; Kamar, Sher Bahadur; Pandey, Hemaraj; Chaudhary, Ashok",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/epidemiology; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel/psychology; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; COVID-19 Vaccines; Communicable Disease Control/organization &amp;amp; administration; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Nepal/epidemiology; Pandemics; Patient Isolation/methods; SARS-CoV-2; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult",20201123.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.33314/jnhrc.v18i3.2816,covidwho-934731,1999-6217,3,J Nepal Health Res Counc,en,NP,2020.0,"J Nepal Health Res Counc;18(3): 466-471, 2020 Nov 14.

"Although the influenza vaccine is widely recognized as an effective preventive measure, influenza vaccination rates among U.S. adults remain low. Moreover, influenza-related respiratory illnesses may increase the risk of adverse outcomes of COVID-19. Thus, this study examines the mechanisms involved in influenza vaccination uptake. Specifically, this study investigates how health information sources are associated with perceived vaccine efficacy and safety, which, in turn, associated with influenza vaccine uptake. Analyzing cross-sectional survey data from a national U.S. adult sample (N =?19,420), mediation analyses were conducted. Results revealed that considering vaccine efficacy, health information seekers who assigned more value to medical professionals, medical journals, and newspaper articles were more likely to perceive a vaccine as effective, thus being more likely to receive the influenza vaccine. By contrast, individuals who placed more value in social media were less likely to perceive vaccine efficacy, and, in turn, were less likely to get the influenza vaccine. Turning to vaccine safety, the value ascribed to medical professionals was positively associated with vaccine safety, which, in turn, related to influenza vaccine uptake. By contrast, social media, family or friends, and promotions were negatively associated with vaccine safety, and then influenza vaccine uptake.","Hwang, Juwon",,MEDLINE,"Consumer Health Information/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Influenza Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; Social Media/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Influenza Vaccines/adverse effects; Influenza, Human/prevention &amp;amp; control; Male; Middle Aged; United States; Young Adult",20201119.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10810730.2020.1840675,covidwho-926199,1087-0415,9,J Health Commun,en,US,2020.0,"J Health Commun;25(9): 727-735, 2020 09 01.

"Background: Seroprevalence studies for COVID-19 evaluate the extent of undetected transmission in a defined community, with special significance among health care workers (HCW) owing to their greater exposure and potential to transmit. Methods: A total of 1122 HCW (approximately 25% of the employees) of a large tertiary care hospital in India were recruited for this cross-sectional study. COVID PCR-positive HCW were excluded. Based on their risk-assessment, participants were grouped into three categories. A questionnaire was administered and they were tested for SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using the chemiluminescence. Results: The overall seroprevalence among workers was 11.94%, which included 19.85% in COVID units, 11.09% in non-COVID units, and 8% in administrative workers (p=0.007). Antibody prevalence was highest in the department of gastroenterology (11.94%), followed by oncology (10.53%), pathology (10.26%), emergency medicine (7.84%) and critical care medicine (7%). Housekeeping staff, food and beverage staff, lab assistants and technicians had higher seroprevalence rate than doctors and nurses (p &lt; 0.0001). HCW with a history of BCG vaccination in childhood and those who received an adequate prophylactic dose of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) had a lower seroprevalence as compared to those who did not (7.31% vs. 16.8% and 1.30% vs. 11.25% respectively). Conclusion: BCG vaccination, HCQ prophylaxis, and the job profile influence the seroprevalence rate in HCW. Seroprevalence rate and follow-up evaluation of its durability may help hospitals to triage their staff at risk, rationalize their placement, prioritize the use of PPE, thereby potentially reducing the risk.","Goenka, Mahesh; Afzalpurkar, Shivaraj; Goenka, Usha; Das, Sudipta Sekhar; Mukherjee, Mohuya; Jajodia, Surabhi; Shah, Bhavik Bharat; Patil, Vikram Uttam; Rodge, Gajanan; Khan, Ujjwayini; Bandyopadhyay, Syamasis",,MEDLINE,"Coronavirus Infections; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Personnel; Humans; India/epidemiology; SARS-CoV-2; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Tertiary Care Centers",20201119.0,,covidwho-924911,0004-5772,11,J Assoc Physicians India,en,IN,2020.0,"J Assoc Physicians India;68(11): 14-19, 2020 Nov.

"Little is known about the time-dependent immune responses in severe COVID-19. Data of 15 consecutive patients were sequentially recorded from intensive care unit admission. Lymphocyte subsets and total monocyte and subsets counts were monitored as well as the expression of HLA-DR. For 5 patients, SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell polyfunctionality was assessed against Spike and Nucleoprotein SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Non-specific inflammation markers were increased in all patients. Median monocyte HLA-DR expression was below the 8,000 AB/C threshold defining acquired immunodepression. A &quot;V&quot; trend curve for lymphopenia, monocyte numbers, and HLA-DR expression was observed with a nadir between days 11 and 14 after symptoms&#039; onset. Intermediate CD14++CD16+ monocytes increased early with a reduction in classic CD14++CD16- monocytes.

"COVID-19 pandemic brings with it a new reality and changes in the context of traditional nursing clinical training. Intern-nursing students face challenges in providing care for suspected and confirmed patients with COVID-19. This cross-sectional descriptive study aimed to explore the mental strain and changes in the psychological health hub among the intern-nursing students during COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of 150 intern-nursing students from 13 pediatric and medical-surgical units at Alexandria University Hospitals completed the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome COVID-19 Staff Questionnaire and rated their psychological distress on the General Health Questionnaire.

Moreover, the availability of cure or vaccine for the disease was the most important motivational factor to participate in future outbreaks (2.64?¡À?0.77). Regarding intern-nursing students&#039; psychological health hub, 77.3% of them felt under strain, worthless and depressed (64.7%, 62.7%) since the influx of COVID-19 pandemic. Binary logistic regression indicated that students&#039; age (23-24), clinical experience (8 months) and clinical placement in adults&#039; units served as risk factor for developing psychological distress while, male gender and training in pediatric units were protective factors.

"Importance: Vaccination hesitancy-the reluctance or refusal to be vaccinated-is a leading global health threat (World Health Organization, 2019). It is imperative to identify the prevalence of vaccination hesitancy for SARS-CoV2 in order to understand the scope of the problem and to identify its motivational roots in order to proactively prepare to address the problem when a vaccine eventually becomes available. Objective: To identify (1) the prevalence of vaccination hesitancy for a SARS-CoV2 vaccine, (2) the motivational roots of this hesitancy, and (3) the most promising incentives for improving the likelihood of vaccination uptake when a vaccine does become available. Design Setting and Participants: A cross-sectional sample of 3,674 American and Canadian adults assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020. Main Outcomes: Measures of vaccination intention (i.e., &quot;If a vaccine for COVID-19 was available, would you get vaccinated?&quot;), attitudes toward vaccines in general and specific to SARS-CoV2 using the Vaccination Attitudes Examination Scale, and incentives for getting vaccinated for those who reported they would not get vaccinated. Results: Many American (25%) and Canadian (20%) respondents said that they would not get vaccinated against SARS-CoV2 if a vaccine was available. Non-adherence rates of this magnitude would make it difficult or impossible to achieve herd immunity. Vaccine rejection was most strongly correlated with mistrust of vaccine benefit, and also correlated with worry about unforeseen future effects, concerns about commercial profiteering from pharmaceutical companies, and preferences for natural immunity. When asked about incentives for getting vaccinated, respondents were most likely to report that evidence for rigorous testing and safety of the vaccine were of greatest importance. Conclusions and Relevance: Vaccination hesitancy is a major looming problem for COVID-19. To improve vaccine uptake, it is imperative that the vaccine is demonstrated to the public to be rigorously tested and not perceived as rushed or premature in its dissemination.","Taylor, Steven; Landry, Caeleigh A; Paluszek, Michelle M; Groenewoud, Rosalind; Rachor, Geoffrey S; Asmundson, Gordon J G",,MEDLINE,,20201110.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.575950,covidwho-914449,1664-1078,,Front Psychol,en,CH,2020.0,"Front Psychol;11: 575950, 2020.

"Purpose: This study aims to estimate the acceptability of a future vaccine against COVID-19 and associated factors if offered in Congolese health-care workers (HCWs), since they have the highest direct exposure to the disease. Patients and Methods: We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study among 23 Congolese referral hospitals, including three university hospitals, located in three towns from March through 30 April 2020. The main outcome variable was healthcare workers&#039; acceptance of a future vaccine against COVID-19. The associated factors of vaccination willingness were identified through a logistic regression analysis. Results: A sample of 613 HCWs participated in the study and completed the study questionnaire, including 312 (50.9%) men and 301 (49.1%) women. Only 27.7% of HCWs said that they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine if it was available. From the logistic regression analysis, male healthcare workers (ORa=1.17, 95% CI: 1.15-2.60), primarily doctors (ORa=1.59; 95% CI:1.03-2.44) and having a positive attitude towards a COVID-19 vaccine (ORa=11.49; 95% CI: 5.88-22.46) were significantly associated with reporting willingness to be vaccinated. Conclusion: For acceptability of vaccination against COVID-19 among others education among HCWs is crucial because health professionals&#039; attitudes about vaccines are an important determinant of their own vaccine uptake and their likelihood of recommending the vaccine to their patients.","Kabamba Nzaji, Michel; Kabamba Ngombe, Leon; Ngoie Mwamba, Guillaume; Banza Ndala, Deca Blood; Mbidi Miema, Judith; Luhata Lungoyo, Christophe; Lora Mwimba, Bertin; Cikomola Mwana Bene, Aim¨¦; Mukamba Musenga, Elisabeth",,MEDLINE,,20201110.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.2147/POR.S271096,covidwho-914330,1179-7266,,Pragmat Obs Res,en,NZ,2020.0,"Pragmat Obs Res;11: 103-109, 2020.

"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented public health threat, both in scope and response. With no vaccine available, the public is advised to practice non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) including social distancing, mask-wearing, and washing hands. However, little is known about public perceptions of the effectiveness of these measures, and high perceived effectiveness is likely to be critical in order to achieve widespread adoption of NPI. METHODS: In May 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among U.S. adults (N = 3,474). The primary outcome was a six-item measure assessing perceived effectiveness of recommended behaviors to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection from 1 (not at all effective) to 5 (extremely effective). The sample was divided into &quot;higher&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; perceived effectiveness groups. Covariates included demographics, healthcare characteristics, and health beliefs. Variables that were significant at p&lt;0.01 in bivariate analyses were entered into a multivariable logistic regression and a best-fit model was created using a cutoff of p&lt;0.01 to stay in the model. RESULTS: Mean age was 45.5 years and most participants were non-Hispanic White (63%) and female (52.4%). The high perceived effectiveness group was slightly larger than the low perceived effectiveness group (52.7% vs. 47.3%). Almost all health belief variables were significant in the best-fit regression model. COVID-19-related worry (aOR = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.64-2.02), and perceived threat to physical health (aOR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.20-1.45) were positively associated with perceived effectiveness while perceived severity of COVID-19 (0.84; 95% CI = 0.73-0.96) and perceived likelihood of infection (0.85; 95% CI = 0.77-0.94) switched directions in the adjusted model and were negatively associated with perceived effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: This research indicates people generally believe NPI are effective, but there was variability based on health beliefs and there are mixed rates of engagement in these behaviors. Public health efforts should focus on increasing perceived severity and threat of SARS-CoV-2-related disease, while promoting NPI as effective in reducing threat.","Kasting, Monica L; Head, Katharine J; Hartsock, Jane A; Sturm, Lynne; Zimet, Gregory D",,MEDLINE,"Betacoronavirus/pathogenicity; Coronavirus Infections/prevention &amp;amp; control; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Pandemics/prevention &amp;amp; control; Pneumonia, Viral/prevention &amp;amp; control; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Adult; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; European Continental Ancestry Group/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Female; Hand Disinfection; Humans; Male; Masks/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Middle Aged; Psychological Distance; Public Health/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires",20201109.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241662,covidwho-910302,1932-6203,11,PLoS One,en,US,2020.0,"PLoS One;15(11): e0241662, 2020.

"The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting national and international public health. Routine childhood immunization may be adversely affected by COVID-19 mitigation measures. We aimed to identify the prevalence of delayed immunization and explore the reasons and barriers for delayed immunization during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Qassim region, Saudi Arabia. We conducted a cross-sectional study using an online self-administered questionnaire for parents of children under two years of age during the period from 1 May to 30 June 2020. Most of the 749 participants (82.6%) were mothers, with 31 to 40 years being the most common age group (49.8%). Nearly three-quarters (73.2%) of the parents had appointments scheduled for their child&#039;s vaccination during the pandemic, and approximately 23.4% of the parents reported a delay of more than one month in the immunization of their child. The most common reason for the delay was the fear of being infected by COVID-19 (60.9%). Large household size and lack of insurance were risk factors for immunization delay. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the timeliness of routine childhood immunization in Saudi Arabia. Childhood immunization should be prioritized, as well as the implementation of focused strategies to achieve significant and sustainable vaccination rates during pandemics.","Alsuhaibani, Mohammed; Alaqeel, Aqeel",,MEDLINE,,20201109.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8040581,covidwho-908823,2076-393X,4,,en,CH,2020.0,Vaccines (Basel);8(4)2020 Oct 03. ,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Routine Childhood Immunization in Saudi Arabia.,article,,,8
"The urgency to develop a vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) has waxed stronger in speed, scale, and scope. However, wisdom dictates that we take a vantage position and start to examine the demographic predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. The objective of this study was to examine the role of health locus of control (HLOC) in the relationship between religiosity and COVID-19 vaccination intention. In a cross-sectional survey (N = 501), we found a significantly negative association between religiosity and COVID-19 vaccination intention. This relationship was partially mediated by external HLOC.

"Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in most infected individuals 10-15 d after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. However, due to the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population, it is not known how long antibody responses will be maintained or whether they will provide protection from reinfection. Using sequential serum samples collected up to 94 d post onset of symptoms (POS) from 65 individuals with real-time quantitative PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, we show seroconversion (immunoglobulin (Ig)M, IgA, IgG) in &gt;95% of cases and neutralizing antibody responses when sampled beyond 8 d POS. We show that the kinetics of the neutralizing antibody response is typical of an acute viral infection, with declining neutralizing antibody titres observed after an initial peak, and that the magnitude of this peak is dependent on disease severity. Although some individuals with high peak infective dose (ID50 &gt; 10,000) maintained neutralizing antibody titres &gt;1,000 at &gt;60 d POS, some with lower peak ID50 had neutralizing antibody titres approaching baseline within the follow-up period. A similar decline in neutralizing antibody titres was observed in a cohort of 31 seropositive healthcare workers. The present study has important implications when considering widespread serological testing and antibody protection against reinfection with SARS-CoV-2, and may suggest that vaccine boosters are required to provide long-lasting protection.","Seow, Jeffrey; Graham, Carl; Merrick, Blair; Acors, Sam; Pickering, Suzanne; Steel, Kathryn J A; Hemmings, Oliver; O&#039;Byrne, Aoife; Kouphou, Neophytos; Galao, Rui Pedro; Betancor, Gilberto; Wilson, Harry D; Signell, Adrian W; Winstone, Helena; Kerridge, Claire; Huettner, Isabella; Jimenez-Guarde?o, Jose M; Lista, Maria Jose; Temperton, Nigel; Snell, Luke B; Bisnauthsing, Karen; Moore, Amelia; Green, Adrian; Martinez, Lauren; Stokes, Brielle; Honey, Johanna; Izquierdo-Barras, Alba; Arbane, Gill; Patel, Amita; Tan, Mark Kia Ik; O&#039;Connell, Lorcan; O&#039;Hara, Geraldine; MacMahon, Eithne; Douthwaite, Sam; Nebbia, Gaia; Batra, Rahul; Martinez-Nunez, Rocio; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Edgeworth, Jonathan D; Neil, Stuart J D; Malim, Michael H; Doores, Katie J",,MEDLINE,"Antibodies, Neutralizing/immunology; COVID-19/immunology; SARS-CoV-2/immunology; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Neutralizing/blood; Antibodies, Viral/blood; Antibodies, Viral/immunology; COVID-19/blood; COVID-19/pathology; Female; Humans; Kinetics; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Seroconversion; Severity of Illness Index; Young Adult",20201030.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41564-020-00813-8,covidwho-892039,2058-5276,12,Nat Microbiol,en,GB,2020.0,"Nat Microbiol;5(12): 1598-1607, 2020 12.

"As with other countries globally, Rwanda has faced a recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) against a backdrop of an HIV epidemic. At present, there is no successful cure or vaccine for both COVID-19 and HIV. People with underlying conditions, including HIV, are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 manifestations. This underscores the need to enhance the knowledge, attitudes, and practice of people living with HIV (PLWH) to protect this population against COVID-19. An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from August 31 to September 18, 2020 among 376 participants who were selected by a simple random sampling technique. A?pretested and structured self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Quality scores were calculated as a measure of the participants&#039; knowledge, attitudes, and practice?(KAP) levels. The student t-test was used to compare continuous variables between low (&lt;65%) and high (&amp;#8805;65%) KAP scores. The chi-square test was used to determine the association between KAP scores and categorical variables. All decisions on statistical tests were concluded at 5% level of significance. All statistical analysis was performed using STATA statistical package version 11.2 (STATA Corp., Texas, USA). Of the 376 participants, 363 (97%) obtained a high knowledge score, while more than a quarter of the participants (26%) had a poor attitude score, and the majority (90%) having a high practice score. There was no association between gender, age, place of residence, employment, or duration on ART and knowledge score. Employment status and duration on antiretroviral treatment (ART) were significantly associated with attitude scores (p = 0.004 and p = 0.013, respectively). Gender and duration on ART were significantly associated with practice scores (p = 0.02 and p = 0.012, respectively). There was a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.57) between knowledge and attitude scores, and knowledge and practice scores (r = 0.55). There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.67) between attitude scores and practice scores. Health education programs tailored for PLWH and aimed at mobilizing and improving COVID-19-related knowledge, attitude, and practice should be prioritized in the Rwandan COVID-19 response.","Iradukunda, Patrick Gad; Pierre, Gashema; Muhozi, Valens; Denhere, Knowledge; Dzinamarira, Tafadzwa",,MEDLINE,"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/psychology; COVID-19/psychology; Employment/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Health Education/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/epidemiology; Adult; COVID-19/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Epidemics; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Rwanda; Surveys and Questionnaires",20201030.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10900-020-00938-1,covidwho-891910,1573-3610,2,J Community Health,en,NL,2021.0,"J Community Health;46(2): 245-250, 2021 04.

"BACKGROUND: Empirical data on the consequences of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on HIV care are lacking. We surveyed people living with HIV (PLWH) in different countries to investigate whether their medical follow-up and psychosocial well-being had been compromised due to COVID-19 and associated restrictions. METHODS: In April 2020, a cross-sectional survey among PLWH was conducted using a web-based multilingual questionnaire. The research tool assessed HIV follow-up, psychosocial well-being, COVID-19 (flu-like) symptoms and prevention measures. Consenting respondents provided answers anonymously. RESULTS: Three hundred seventeen PLWH were included (mean age 43.4 ¡À 11.7; 71.6% men); 60.3% of participants resided in Belgium and Brazil. One hundred forty (44.2%) reported experiencing a cold with at least one flu-like symptom since January 2020. Of the 18 who reported COVID-19 test results, 4 (22.2%) were positive. Seventy-four (23.3%) respondents screened positive for major depressive disorders, whereas 72 (22.7%) had generalized anxiety disorders. Fifty-six (17.7%) respondents reported difficulties in obtaining antiretroviral medications because of COVID-19-related measures. Adaptations of HIV care during the COVID-19 outbreak included greater quantities of antiretroviral refill in 67 (21.1%), phone consultations in 25 (7.9%), and new refill sites in 12 (3.9%). Factors associated with a reduced risk of experiencing flu-like symptoms included flu vaccination during the past 12 months (P = 0.005) and adaptations of HIV care during the COVID-19 pandemic (P = 0.010). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 and associated restrictive measures seem detrimental to the well-being and follow-up of PLWH. We recommend that health systems devise innovative approaches for antiretroviral provision and psychosocial support to PLWH during such outbreaks.","Siewe Fodjo, Joseph Nelson; Villela, Edlaine Faria de Moura; Van Hees, Stijn; Dos Santos, Thalia Tib¨¦rio; Vanholder, Pieter; Reyntiens, Patrick; Van den Bergh, Rafael; Colebunders, Robert",,MEDLINE,"Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections/complications; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; HIV Infections/complications; HIV Infections/psychology; Pneumonia, Viral/complications; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Adult; Aged; Anti-HIV Agents/therapeutic use; Anxiety; Belgium; Brazil; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Europe, Eastern; Female; HIV Infections/drug therapy; Humans; Influenza, Human/complications; Influenza, Human/prevention &amp;amp; control; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Psychology; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",20201028.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/QAI.0000000000002468,covidwho-889636,1944-7884,3,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,en,US,2020.0,"J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr;85(3): 257-262, 2020 11 01.

"Severe COVID-19 is associated with profound lymphopenia and an elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio. We applied a novel dimer avoidance multiplexed polymerase chain reaction next-generation sequencing assay to analyze T (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires. Surprisingly, TCR repertoires were markedly diminished during the early onset of severe disease but recovered during the convalescent stage. Monitoring TCR repertoires could serve as an indicative biomarker to predict disease progression and recovery. Panoramic concurrent assessment of BCR repertoires demonstrated isotype switching and a transient but dramatic early IgA expansion. Dominant B cell clonal expansion with decreased diversity occurred following recovery from infection. Profound changes in T cell homeostasis raise critical questions about the early events in COVID-19 infection and demonstrate that immune repertoire analysis is a promising method for evaluating emergent host immunity to SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, with great implications for assessing vaccination and other immunological therapies.","Niu, Xuefeng; Li, Song; Li, Pingchao; Pan, Wenjing; Wang, Qian; Feng, Ying; Mo, Xiaoneng; Yan, Qihong; Ye, Xianmiao; Luo, Jia; Qu, Linbing; Weber, Daniel; Byrne-Steele, Miranda L; Wang, Zhe; Yu, Fengjia; Li, Fang; Myers, Richard M; Lotze, Michael T; Zhong, Nanshan; Han, Jian; Chen, Ling",,MEDLINE,"B-Lymphocytes/immunology; Betacoronavirus/immunology; Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics; Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics; T-Lymphocytes/immunology; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections/immunology; Coronavirus Infections/pathology; Female; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Lymphopenia/pathology; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral/immunology; Pneumonia, Viral/pathology; SARS-CoV-2",20201023.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.582010,covidwho-886168,1664-3224,,Front Immunol,en,CH,2020.0,"Front Immunol;11: 582010, 2020.

"BACKGROUND: The availability of a COVID-19 vaccine has been heralded as key to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 vaccination programme success will rely on public willingness to be vaccinated. METHODS: We used a multi-methods approach - involving an online cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interviews - to investigate parents&#039; and guardians&#039; views on the acceptability of a future COVID-19 vaccine. 1252 parents and guardians (aged 16?+?years) who reported living in England with a child aged 18?months or under completed the survey. Nineteen survey participants were interviewed. FINDINGS: Most survey participants reported they would likely accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves (Definitely 55.8%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 34.3%) and their child/children (Definitely 48.2%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 40.9%). Less than 4% of survey participants reported that they would definitely not accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Survey participants were more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves than their child/children. Participants that self-reported as Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity were almost 3 times more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children than White British, White Irish and White Other participants. Survey participants from lower-income households were also more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine. In open-text survey responses and interviews, self-protection from COVID-19 was reported as the main reason for vaccine acceptance. Common concerns identified in open-text responses and interviews were around COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness, mostly prompted by the newness and rapid development of the vaccine. CONCLUSION: Information on how COVID-19 vaccines are developed and tested, including their safety and efficacy, must be communicated clearly to the public. To prevent inequalities in uptake, it is crucial to understand and address factors that may affect COVID-19 vaccine acceptability in ethnic minority and lower-income groups who are disproportionately affected by COVID-19.","Bell, Sadie; Clarke, Richard; Mounier-Jack, Sandra; Walker, Jemma L; Paterson, Pauline",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19 Vaccines/therapeutic use; Parents; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Vaccination; Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; England/ethnology; Ethnic Groups; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Vaccination/psychology; Young Adult",20201020.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.10.027,covidwho-872534,1873-2518,49,Vaccine,en,NL,2020.0,"Vaccine;38(49): 7789-7798, 2020 11 17.

"Many conspiracy theories appeared along with the COVID-19 pandemic. Since it is documented that conspiracy theories negatively affect vaccination intentions, these beliefs might become a crucial matter in the near future. We conducted two cross-sectional studies examining the relationship between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, vaccine attitudes, and the intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19 when a vaccine becomes available. We also examined how these beliefs predicted support for a controversial medical treatment, namely, chloroquine. In an exploratory study 1 (N = 409), two subdimensions of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs were associated with negative attitudes toward vaccine science. These results were partly replicated and extended in a pre-registered study 2 (N = 396). Moreover, we found that COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs (among which, conspiracy beliefs about chloroquine), as well as a conspiracy mentality (i.e., predisposition to believe in conspiracy theories) negatively predicted participants&#039; intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in the future. Lastly, conspiracy beliefs predicted support for chloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. Interestingly, none of the conspiracy beliefs referred to the dangers of the vaccines.

"On 8 April 2020, the Chinese government lifted the lockdown and opened up public transportation in Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. After 76 days in lockdown, Wuhan residents were allowed to travel outside of the city and go back to work. Yet, given that there is still no vaccine for the virus, this leaves many doubting whether life will indeed go back to normal. The aim of this research was to track longitudinal changes in motivation for self-isolating, life-structured, indicators of well-being and mental health after lockdown was lifted. We have recruited 462 participants in Wuhan, China, prior to lockdown lift between 3 and 7 April 2020 (Time 1), and have followed up with 292 returning participants between 18 and 22 April 2020 (Time 2), 284 between 6 and 10 May 2020 (Time 3), and 279 between 25 and 29 May 2020 (Time 4).

"A coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus has appeared in China by the end of 2019 and later recognized as a global pandemic. This pandemic has evolved as a global public health menace. It has affected every aspect of human life. In line with these concerns, governments and the scientific community react promptly to the outbreak of this pandemic. These efforts are devoted to develop vaccine and curative medicines. Further efforts are dedicated to assessing the impacts of the pandemic in relation to socioeconomic, psychological, and environmental dimensions. In this regard, it is important to follow up developments and research activities on this global issue. The present work intended to tracking the current hotspots and research trends on COVID-19 in environmental fields. Bibliometric analysis and visualization mapping were utilized with the objective of revealing and evaluating the developments in knowledge on COVID-2019 and its impacts based on a collection of environmental sources.

"Objectives: There is an incomplete understanding of the host humoral immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV)-2, which underlies COVID-19, during acute infection. Host factors such as age and sex as well as the kinetics and functionality of antibody responses are important factors to consider as vaccine development proceeds. The receptor-binding domain of the CoV spike (RBD-S) protein mediates host cell binding and infection and is a major target for vaccine design to elicit neutralising antibodies. Methods: We assessed serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD-S IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies by a two-step ELISA and neutralising antibodies in a cross-sectional study of hospitalised COVID-19 patients of varying disease severities. Anti-RBD-S IgG levels were also determined in asymptomatic seropositives. Results: We found equivalent levels of anti-RBD-S antibodies in male and female patients and no age-related deficiencies even out to 93?years of age. The anti-RBD-S response was evident as little as 6?days after onset of symptoms and for at least 5?weeks after symptom onset. Anti-RBD-S IgG, IgM and IgA responses were simultaneously induced within 10?days after onset, with anti-RBD-S IgG sustained over a 5-week period. Anti-RBD-S antibodies strongly correlated with neutralising activity. Lastly, anti-RBD-S IgG responses were higher in symptomatic COVID-19 patients during acute infection compared with asymptomatic seropositive donors. Conclusion: Our results suggest that anti-RBD-S IgG reflect functional immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, but do not completely explain age- and sex-related disparities in COVID-19 fatalities.","Graham, Nancy R; Whitaker, Annalis N; Strother, Camilla A; Miles, Ashley K; Grier, Dore; McElvany, Benjamin D; Bruce, Emily A; Poynter, Matthew E; Pierce, Kristen K; Kirkpatrick, Beth D; Stapleton, Renee D; An, Gary; van den Broek-Altenburg, Eline; Botten, Jason W; Crothers, Jessica W; Diehl, Sean A",,MEDLINE,,20201009.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cti2.1189,covidwho-837988,2050-0068,10,Clin Transl Immunology,en,AU,2020.0,"Clin Transl Immunology;9(10): e1189, 2020.

"BACKGROUND: Social distancing measures (e.g., avoiding travel, limiting physical contact with people outside of one&#039;s household, and maintaining a 1 or 2-metre distance between self and others when in public, depending on the country) are the primary strategies used to prevent transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 virus that causes COVID-19. Given that there is no effective treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, it is important to identify barriers and facilitators to adherence to social distancing to inform ongoing and future public health campaigns. METHOD: This cross-sectional study was conducted online with a convenience sample of English-speaking adults. The survey was administered over the course of three weeks (March 30 -April 16, 2020) when social distancing measures were well-enforced in North America and Europe. Participants were asked to complete measures assessing socio-demographic characteristics, psychological constructs, including motivations to engage in social distancing, prosocial attitudes, distress, and social distancing behaviors. Descriptive (mean, standard deviation, percentage) and inferential statistics (logistic regression) were used to describes endorsement rates for various motivations, rates of adherence to social distancing recommendations, and predictors of adherence. RESULTS: Data were collected from 2013 adults living primarily in North America and Europe. Most frequently endorsed motivations to engage in social distancing (or facilitators) included &quot;I want to protect others&quot; (86%), &quot;I want to protect myself&quot; (84%), and I feel a sense of responsibility to protect our community&quot; (84%). Most frequently endorsed motivations against social distancing (or barriers) included &quot;There are many people walking on the streets in my area&quot; (31%), &quot;I have friends or family who need me to run errands for them&quot; (25%), &quot;I don&#039;t trust the messages my government provides about the pandemic&quot; (13%), and &quot;I feel stressed when I am alone or in isolation&quot; (13%). Adherence to social distancing recommendations ranged from 45% for &quot;working from home or remotely&quot; to 90% for &quot;avoiding crowded places/non-essential travel&quot;, with men and younger individuals (18-24 years) showing lower adherence compared to women and older individuals. CONCLUSION: This study found that adherence to social distancing recommendations vary depending on the behaviour, with none of the surveyed behaviours showing perfect adherence. Strongest facilitators included wanting to protect the self, feeling a responsibility to protect the community, and being able to work/study remotely; strongest barriers included having friends or family who needed help with running errands and socializing in order to avoid feeling lonely. Future interventions to improve adherence to social distancing measures should couple individual-level strategies targeting key barriers to social distancing identified herein, with effective institutional measures and public health interventions. Public health campaigns should continue to highlight compassionate attitudes towards social distancing.","Coroiu, Adina; Moran, Chelsea; Campbell, Tavis; Geller, Alan C",,MEDLINE,"Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Coronavirus Infections/prevention &amp;amp; control; Guideline Adherence; Pandemics/prevention &amp;amp; control; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Pneumonia, Viral/prevention &amp;amp; control; Public Health; Quarantine/methods; Social Isolation; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Coronavirus Infections/virology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Europe/epidemiology; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; North America/epidemiology; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Pneumonia, Viral/virology; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",20201008.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239795,covidwho-835952,1932-6203,10,PLoS One,en,US,2020.0,"PLoS One;15(10): e0239795, 2020.

"Introduction The spread of COVID-19 has challenged the paramedic community¡¯s ability to provide health care, maintain personal safety, and implement evidence informed decisions and programs. The study objective was to examine the published literature related to paramedicine and pandemics. Methods A rapid review of research derived from an existing broad database of literature generated between 2006 and 2019 was used. We conducted a targeted secondary search of this database to identify studies of pandemics in paramedicine contexts and included three levels of screening. We used content analysis to identify broad themes and subthemes, and provide summaries and descriptions of each. Results From 54,638 citations, our search identified 24 citations representing eight countries. The most common method of enquiry was cross-sectional survey (n=10). Five broad themes (and 15 subthemes) were identified: general planning and preparedness (impact to paramedic service operations, roles and responsibilities, communication centre preparedness, paramedic service preparedness, training); workforce (availability of personal protective equipment, safety of family, perception of risk, trust in the organisation); ethics (duty, resource allocation); (triage (needless exposure to infection, transmission of disease); and vaccination (vaccination information, organisational readiness). Conclusion The evidence base describes the importance of pandemic planning and preparedness for emergency medical services and integrating these activities into broader public health and healthcare system plans. Although this rapid review provides a foundation to support response plans and research, it is considered ¡®just in time¡¯ for the evolving pandemic, and further work understanding research in paramedicine and pandemics is recommended.","Cavanagh, Nicola; Tavares, Walter; Taplin, John; Hall, Claire; Weiss, Dale; Blanchard, Ian",,ELSEVIER,,20201007.0,https://doi.org/10.33151/ajp.17.826,covidwho-819611,22027270,17,Australas.

"BACKGROUND: Without any pharmaceutical intervention and vaccination, the only way to combat Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is to slow down the spread of the disease by adopting non-pharmaceutical public health interventions (PHIs). Patient isolation, lockdown, quarantine, social distancing, changes in health care provision, and mass screening are the most common non-pharmaceutical PHIs to cope with the epidemic. However, there is neither systematic evidence on the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical PHIs in controlling the COVID-19 nor on how these interventions work in different contexts. Therefore, in this study we will address two main objectives: 1) to assess the effectiveness of the non-pharmaceutical PHIs in controlling the spread of COVID-19 using a systematic review and meta-analyses; 2) to explore why, how, and for whom these interventions work using a realist review. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review study has two main phases. In the first phase of this study, we will extract data from two main types of studies including quasi-experimental studies (such as quasi-randomized trials, controlled before-after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series studies (ITSs)) and observational studies (such as cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies), written in the English language. We will explore effectiveness of the non-pharmaceutical PHIs targeted either suppression or mitigation strategies (or a combination of both) in controlling the COVID-19 epidemics in the community level. Effectiveness will be considered as the changes in mortality rate, incidence rate, basic reproduction number rate, morbidity rate, rates of hospitalization, rates of intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization, and other health outcomes where possible. We will perform random-effects meta-analyses, if possible, using CMA software. In the second phase, we will conduct a realist review to find out how, why, for whom, and in what circumstances the non-pharmaceutical PHIs work. At the realist review, we will identify and explore Context-Mechanism-Outcome configurations to provide a robust explanation on the effectiveness of the interventions in different contexts using Pawson&#039;s 5-step realist review template including: &quot;clarify scope; search for evidence; appraise primary studies and extract data; synthesize evidence and draw conclusions; and disseminate, implement and evaluate&quot;. Although the steps are presented in a linear manner, in practice, we will follow them in iterative stages to fill any potential overlap. DISCUSSION: The findings of this research will provide a crucial insight into how and in which context the non-pharmaceutical PHIs work in controlling the spread of COVID-19. Conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis in line with a realist review will allow us to draw a robust conclusion on the effects and the way in which the interventions work. Understanding the role of contextual factors in the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical PHIs and the mechanism of this process could enable policymakers to implement appropriate policies and manage the COVID-19 epidemics more efficiently.

"SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, infecting millions of people and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths. The Spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 mediate viral entry and are the main targets for neutralizing antibodies. Understanding the antibody response directed against SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for the development of vaccine, therapeutic, and public health interventions. Here, we perform a cross-sectional study on 106 SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals to evaluate humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 Spike. Most infected individuals elicit anti-Spike antibodies within 2?weeks of the onset of symptoms. The levels of receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) persist over time, and the levels of anti-RBD IgM decrease after symptom resolution. Although most individuals develop neutralizing antibodies within 2?weeks of infection, the level of neutralizing activity is significantly decreased over time. Our results highlight the importance of studying the persistence of neutralizing activity upon natural SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Pr¨¦vost, J¨¦r¨¦mie; Gasser, Romain; Beaudoin-Bussi¨¨res, Guillaume; Richard, Jonathan; Duerr, Ralf; Laumaea, Annemarie; Anand, Sai Priya; Goyette, Guillaume; Benlarbi, Mehdi; Ding, Shilei; Medjahed, Halima; Lewin, Antoine; Perreault, Jos¨¦e; Tremblay, Tony; Gendron-Lepage, Gabrielle; Gauthier, Nicolas; Carrier, Marc; Marcoux, Diane; Pich¨¦, Alain; Lavoie, Myriam; Benoit, Alexandre; Loungnarath, Vilayvong; Brochu, Gino; Haddad, Elie; Stacey, Hannah D; Miller, Matthew S; Desforges, Marc; Talbot, Pierre J; Maule, Graham T Gould; C?t¨¦, Marceline; Therrien, Christian; Serhir, Bouchra; Bazin, Ren¨¦e; Roger, Michel; Finzi, Andr¨¦s",,MEDLINE,,20201002.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2020.100126,covidwho-807604,2666-3791,7,Cell Rep Med,en,US,2020.0,"Cell Rep Med;1(7): 100126, 2020 Oct 20.

"OBJECTIVE: To examine perceptions, behaviors, and impacts surrounding COVID-19 early in the pandemic response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 1,030 U.S. adults was administered on March 31st, 2020. This survey examined attitudes toward media, government, and community responses to COVID-19 by political ideology and sociodemographic factors. Knowledge, anxieties, and impacts of COVID-19 were also assessed. RESULTS: Conservatives were more likely to report that COVID-19 was receiving too much media coverage and people were generally overreacting; liberals were more likely to report the government had not done enough in response to the pandemic. Females and those with lower income experienced more COVID-19 related economic anxieties. Those working and with children at home reported higher social, home, and work disruption. Social distancing behaviors were more common among liberals and were associated with increases in depressive symptoms. General knowledge about COVID-19 was widely exhibited across the sample, however, Black and Hispanic respondents were less likely to correctly answer questions about the availability of a vaccine and modes of transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Public health experts should consider the political climate in crafting messaging that appeals to the values of those across the political spectrum. Research on the COVID-19 pandemic should continue to monitor the effects of social distancing on mental health and among vulnerable populations.","Christensen, Sarah R; Pilling, Emily B; Eyring, J B; Dickerson, Grace; Sloan, Chantel D; Magnusson, Brianna M",,MEDLINE,"Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Politics; Public Opinion; Social Isolation; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control/methods; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Mass Media; Middle Aged; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States",20200925.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239693,covidwho-791754,1932-6203,9,PLoS One,en,US,2020.0,"PLoS One;15(9): e0239693, 2020.

"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is an emerging pandemic with heightened concerns for people with compromised immune systems, including people living with HIV. PURPOSE: In the absence of a vaccine, public health messaging to mitigate risks for COVID-19 primarily focuses on social distancing. Because people living with HIV commonly experience mistreatment associated with HIV, their response to social distancing may be complicated by psychosocial attitudes associated with COVID-19. METHODS: To evaluate these relationships, we conducted a rapid-response, cross-sectional survey with people living with HIV (N = 149) to assess social distancing practices, COVID-19 discriminatory attitudes, COVID-19 xenophobic attitudes, HIV microaggressions, and concern over contracting COVID-19. Data were collected from participants enrolled in a larger ongoing study between March 30, 2020 and April 17, 2020. RESULTS: Results indicated that choosing to socially distance to reduce COVID-19 exposure was associated with COVID-19 discriminatory attitudes, concerns of contracting COVID-19, and identifying as transgender. Likewise, social distancing imposed by others (e.g., cancelations and restrictions) was associated with concerns of contracting COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrate that social distancing measures are related to concerns of contracting the virus and discriminatory attitudes toward those who are presumed to be living with COVID-19. These potentially negative psychosocial attitudes toward people perceived to have COVID-19 echo the discriminatory actions and attitudes that we continue to observe in HIV social sciences research.","Berman, Marcie; Eaton, Lisa A; Watson, Ryan J; Andrepont, J L; Kalichman, Seth",,MEDLINE,"Coronavirus Infections/prevention &amp;amp; control; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; HIV Infections/psychology; Pandemics/prevention &amp;amp; control; Pneumonia, Viral/prevention &amp;amp; control; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Social Discrimination/psychology; Social Isolation; Adult; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Prejudice; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",20200918.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/abm/kaaa074,covidwho-772732,1532-4796,10,Ann Behav Med,en,GB,2020.0,"Ann Behav Med;54(10): 728-737, 2020 10 01.

"BACKGROUND: Social media is one of the most rapid and impactful ways of obtaining and delivering information in the modern era. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to rapidly obtain information on public perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors related to COVID-19 in order to identify deficiencies in key areas of public education. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, a survey web link was posted on the social media and messaging platforms Instagram, Twitter, and WhatsApp by the study investigators. Participants, aged &amp;#8805;18 years, filled out the survey on a voluntary basis. The main outcomes measured were knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, protective measures against COVID-19, and source(s) of information about COVID-19. Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine the effects of age, gender, underlying illness, and working or studying in the health care industry on the perceived likelihood of acquiring COVID-19 and getting vaccinated. RESULTS: A total of 5677 subjects completed the survey over the course of 1 week. &quot;Fever or chills&quot; (n=4973, 87.6%) and &quot;shortness of breath&quot; (n=4695, 82.7%) were identified as the main symptoms of COVID-19. Washing and sanitizing hands (n=4990, 87.9%) and avoiding public places and crowds (n=4865, 85.7%) were identified as the protective measures most frequently used against COVID-19. Social media was the most utilized source for information on the disease (n=4740, 83.5%), followed by the World Health Organization (n=2844, 50.1%). Subgroup analysis revealed that younger subjects (&lt;35 years), males, and those working or studying in health care reported a higher perceived likelihood of acquiring COVID-19, whereas older subjects, females, and those working or studying in non-health care areas reported a lower perceived likelihood of acquiring COVID-19. Similar trends were observed for vaccination against COVID-19, with older subjects, females, and those working or studying in non-health care sectors reporting a lower likelihood of vaccinating against COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are indicative of a relatively well-informed cohort implementing appropriate protective measures. However, key knowledge deficiencies exist with regards to vaccination against COVID-19, which future efforts should aim at correcting.","Ali, Khawla F; Whitebridge, Simon; Jamal, Mohammad H; Alsafy, Mohammad; Atkin, Stephen L",,MEDLINE,"Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Health Education/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Social Media; Surveys and Questionnaires; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Vaccination; Volunteers; Young Adult",20200918.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/19913,covidwho-771643,1438-8871,9,J Med Internet Res,en,CA,2020.0,"J Med Internet Res;22(9): e19913, 2020 09 08.

"There is an urgent need for effective treatment and preventive vaccine to contain this devastating global pandemic, which requires a comprehensive understanding of humoral responses specific to SARS-CoV-2 during the disease progression and convalescent phase of COVID-19 patients. We continuously monitored the serum IgM and IgG responses specific to four SARS-CoV-2 related antigens, including the nucleoprotein (NP), receptor binding domain (RBD), S1 protein, and ectodomain (ECD) of the spike protein among non-severe and severe COVID-19 patients for seven weeks since disease onset. Most patients generated humoral responses against NP and spike protein-related antigens but with their distinct kinetics profiles. Combined detection of NP and ECD antigens as detecting antigen synergistically improved the sensitivity of the serological assay, compared to that of using NP or RBD as detection antigen. 80.7% of convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients revealed that the varying extents of neutralization activities against SARS-CoV-2. S1-specific and ECD-specific IgA responses were strongly correlated with the neutralization activities in non-severe patients, but not in severe patients. Moreover, the neutralizing activities of the convalescent sera were shown to significantly decline during the period between 21 days to 28 days after hospital discharge, accompanied by a substantial drop in RBD-specific IgA response. Our data provide evidence that are crucial for serological testing, antibody-based intervention, and vaccine design of COVID-19.","Chen, Yuxin; Tong, Xin; Li, Yang; Gu, Bin; Yan, Jiawei; Liu, Yong; Shen, Han; Huang, Rui; Wu, Chao",,MEDLINE,"Antibodies, Neutralizing/pharmacology; Antibodies, Viral/pharmacology; Betacoronavirus/drug effects; Coronavirus Infections/drug therapy; Pneumonia, Viral/drug therapy; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus/antagonists &amp;amp; inhibitors; Antibodies, Neutralizing/immunology; Antibodies, Viral/immunology; Betacoronavirus/pathogenicity; COVID-19; Humans; Immunoglobulin G/blood; Longitudinal Studies; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Serologic Tests; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus/immunology",20200916.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008796,covidwho-760712,1553-7374,9,PLoS Pathog,en,US,2020.0,"PLoS Pathog;16(9): e1008796, 2020 09.

"The emergency caused by Covid-19 pandemic raised interest in studying lifestyles and comorbidities as important determinants of poor Covid-19 prognosis. Data on tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and obesity are still limited, while no data are available on the role of e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products (HTP). To clarify the role of tobacco smoking and other lifestyle habits on COVID-19 severity and progression, we designed a longitudinal observational study titled COvid19 and SMOking in ITaly (COSMO-IT). About 30 Italian hospitals in North, Centre and South of Italy joined the study. Its main aims are: 1) to quantify the role of tobacco smoking and smoking cessation on the severity and progression of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients; 2) to compare smoking prevalence and severity of the disease in relation to smoking in hospitalized COVID-19 patients versus patients treated at home; 3) to quantify the association between other lifestyle factors, such as e-cigarette and HTP use, alcohol and obesity and the risk of unfavourable COVID-19 outcomes. Socio-demographic, lifestyle and medical history information will be gathered for around 3000 hospitalized and 700-1000 home-isolated, laboratory-confirmed, COVID-19 patients. Given the current absence of a vaccine against SARS-COV-2 and the lack of a specific treatment for -COVID-19, prevention strategies are of extreme importance. This project, designed to highly contribute to the international scientific debate on the role of avoidable lifestyle habits on COVID-19 severity, will provide valuable epidemiological data in order to support important recommendations to prevent COVID-19 incidence, progression and mortality.","Cattaruzza, Maria Sofia; Gorini, Giuseppe; Bosetti, Cristina; Boffi, Roberto; Lugo, Alessandra; Veronese, Chiara; Carreras, Giulia; Santucci, Claudia; Stival, Chiara; Pacifici, Roberta; Zag¨¤, Vincenzo; Gallus, Silvano; Giulietti, Federico; Sarzani, Riccardo; Spannella, Francesco; Del Donno, Mario; Tartaglione, Stefania; Marrazzo, Giuseppina; Pelaia, Girolamo; D&#039;Agosto, Vincenzo; Berti, Alice; Voller, Fabio; Cardellicchio, Salvatore; Cresci, Chiara; Foschino Barbaro, Maria Pia; De Palma, Raffaele; Negrini, Simone; Sicbaldi, Vera; Serafini, Antonella; Bisconti, Mario; Refolo, Leonida; Landoni, Giovanni; Rovere, Patrizia; Veronesi, Giulia; Faverio, Paola; Garavello, Werner; Pesci, Alberto; Giacobbe, Raffaella; Martucci, Paola; Parrella, Roberto; Scarano, Francesco; Aiello, Marina; Chetta, Alfredo; Franco, Cosimo; Mangia, Angelo; Carrozzi, Laura; Maggi, Fabrizio; Monzani, Fabio; Pistelli, Francesco; Russo, Patrizia",,MEDLINE,"Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Life Style; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Tobacco Smoking/adverse effects; COVID-19; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Italy/epidemiology; Male; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2; Tobacco Smoking/epidemiology",20200916.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i3.10373,covidwho-761263,2531-6745,3,Acta Biomed,en,IT,2020.0,"Acta Biomed;91(3): e2020062, 2020 08 27.

"Vaccination is the single most important preventive medicine action worldwide. However, there are inequalities in the procurement of vaccines particularly among US ethnic and racial minority males when compared to the rest of the US population. This study explored the reasons given by adult Mexican-origin males residing in Texas, for obtaining or not, immunizations. This was a cross-sectional, exploratory study with a sample of convenience of 401 adult males (age range 18¨C79) who were invited to participate in the study while waiting their turn to receive administrative services at the Mexican Consulate in Austin Texas. Data was collected in Spanish with a seven-item multiple choice questionnaire, using electronic tablets. The majority of respondents received their last vaccination longer than 5 years earlier. A higher percentage of individuals in the older age groups received a vaccine in the last year, as opposed to their younger counterparts who obtained their last immunization 3 to 5 years earlier. Among the reasons given for not getting vaccinated were lack of time or money, feared injections and side effects, insufficient information, interest or motivation. Others did not get vaccines because they perceived themselves to be healthy and did not feel sick. Findings from this study have important implications for future preventive medicine and vaccination practices that reach socially excluded groups in times of COVID-19. Recommendations are made to facilitate access to vaccines to the target group of this study and other socially disadvantaged populations in the global health context.","Snyder, V.

"Conspiracy theories have been proliferating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence suggests that belief in conspiracy theories undermines engagement in pro-health behaviors and support for public health policies. Moreover, previous work suggests that inoculating messages from opinion leaders that expose conspiracy theories as false before people are exposed to them can help to prevent belief in new conspiracies. Goals of this study were to: (a) explore associations between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine intentions, cooperation with public health recommendations, and support for public health policies among U.S. adults and (b) investigate trusted sources of COVID-19 information to inform strategies to address conspiracy beliefs. A cross-sectional, online survey was conducted with 845 U.S. adults in April 2020. Data were analyzed using analyses of variance and multivariable regressions. One-third (33%) of participants believed one or more conspiracies about COVID-19. Participants who believed conspiracies reported that their intentions to vaccinate were 3.9 times lower and indicated less support for COVID-19 public health policies than participants who disbelieved conspiracies. There were no differences in cooperation with public health recommendations by conspiracy belief endorsement in the multivariable regression analysis. Although there were some key differences in trusted sources of COVID-19 information, doctor(s) were the most trusted source of information about COVID-19 overall with 90% of participants trusting doctor(s). Doctor(s) may play a role in addressing COVID-19 conspiracy theories before people are exposed to them to promote COVID-19 prevention efforts.","Earnshaw, Valerie A; Eaton, Lisa A; Kalichman, Seth C; Brousseau, Natalie M; Hill, E Carly; Fox, Annie B",,MEDLINE,"Cooperative Behavior; Coronavirus Infections; Health Behavior; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Policy/trends; Trust/psychology; Vaccination/psychology; Adult; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Coronavirus Infections/prevention &amp;amp; control; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Culture; Female; Humans; Intention; Male; Pandemics/prevention &amp;amp; control; Physician&amp;apos;s Role; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Pneumonia, Viral/prevention &amp;amp; control; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Psychology; Public Health Practice; SARS-CoV-2; United States/epidemiology",20200915.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibaa090,covidwho-756965,1613-9860,4,Transl Behav Med,en,GB,2020.0,"Transl Behav Med;10(4): 850-856, 2020 10 08.

"BACKGROUND: Maintaining health of healthcare workers with vaccination is a major component of pandemic preparedness and acceptance of vaccinations is essential to its success. This study aimed to examine impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on change of influenza vaccination acceptance and identify factors associated with acceptance of potential COVID-19 vaccination. METHOD: A cross-sectional self-administered anonymous questionnaire survey was conducted among nurses in Hong Kong, China during 26 February and 31 March 2020. Their previous acceptance of influenza vaccination and intentions to accept influenza and COVID-19 vaccination were collected. Their relationship with work-related and other factors were examined using multiple multinomial logistic regressions. RESULTS: Responses from 806 participants were retrieved. More nurses changed from vaccination refusal to hesitancy or acceptance than those changed from acceptance to vaccination hesitancy or refusal (15.5% vs 6.8% among all participants, P?&lt;?0.001). 40.0% participants intended to accept COVID-19 vaccination, and those in private sector (OR: 1.67, 95%CI: 1.11-2.51), with chronic conditions (OR: 1.83, 95%CI: 1.22-2.77), encountering with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients (OR: 1.63, 95%CI: 1.14-2.33), accepted influenza vaccination in 2019 (OR: 2.03, 95%CI: 1.47-2.81) had higher intentions to accept it. Reasons for refusal and hesitation for COVID-19 vaccination included &quot;suspicion on efficacy, effectiveness and safety&quot;, &quot;believing it unnecessary&quot;, and &quot;no time to take it&quot;. CONCLUSION: With a low level of COVID-19 acceptance intentions and high proportion of hesitation in both influenza and COVID-19 vaccination, evidence-based planning are needed to improve the uptake of both vaccinations in advance of their implementation. Future studies are needed to explore reasons of change of influenza vaccination acceptance, look for actual behaviour patterns of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance and examine effectiveness of promotion strategies.","Wang, Kailu; Wong, Eliza Lai Yi; Ho, Kin Fai; Cheung, Annie Wai Ling; Chan, Emily Ying Yang; Yeoh, Eng Kiong; Wong, Samuel Yeung Shan",,MEDLINE,"Coronavirus Infections/prevention &amp;amp; control; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Influenza Vaccines/immunology; Influenza, Human/prevention &amp;amp; control; Influenza, Human/psychology; Pandemics/prevention &amp;amp; control; Pneumonia, Viral/prevention &amp;amp; control; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Vaccination/psychology; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Betacoronavirus/pathogenicity; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Coronavirus Infections/immunology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Personnel; Hong Kong/epidemiology; Humans; Influenza Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; Influenza, Human/epidemiology; Influenza, Human/immunology; Intention; Male; Middle Aged; Orthomyxoviridae/pathogenicity; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/psychology; Patient Safety; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Pneumonia, Viral/immunology; SARS-CoV-2; Sex Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Viral Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; Viral Vaccines/immunology",20200914.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.09.021,covidwho-752762,1873-2518,45,Vaccine,en,NL,2020.0,"Vaccine;38(45): 7049-7056, 2020 10 21.

"The current COVID-19 pandemia affects health care systems worldwide, however, to a variable extent depending on the caseload in each country. We aimed to provide a cross-sectional overview of current limitations or adaptions in lung transplant programs in Germany in from January to May 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. A cross-sectional survey assessing various aspects of lung transplant activity was sent to all active lung transplant programs (n = 12) in Germany. Eight centers (66%) responded to the survey within the requested time frame. Four centers (50%) reported their activity is not restricted at all and four centers (50%) reported on moderate general limitations. The overall lung transplant activity in Germany from January to May 2020 contains 128 bilateral and 11 single lung transplantations, which is similar to the same period in the year 2019 (126 bilateral transplantations and 12 single lung transplantations). The results suggest that the influence of the COVID-19 pandemia on lung transplantation activity in Germany has been moderate so far. Nevertheless, adaptions such as extensive testing of donors and recipients were introduced to reduce the likelihood of infections and increase patient safety. Alertness to changes in COVID-19 reproduction rates might be required until effective antiviral therapy or vaccination is available.","Michel, Sebastian; Witt, Christian; Gottlieb, Jens; Aigner, Clemens",,MEDLINE,COVID-19; Lung Transplantation/trends; Cross-Sectional Studies; Donor Selection/trends; Germany; Health Care Surveys; Humans; Lung Transplantation/adverse effects; Patient Safety; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Tissue Donors/supply &amp;amp; distribution; Waiting Lists/mortality,20200914.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1715436,covidwho-752412,1439-1902,1,Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,en,DE,2021.0,"Thorac Cardiovasc Surg;69(1): 92-94, 2021 01.

"OBJECTIVES: Development of a vaccine against COVID-19 will be key to controlling the pandemic. We need to understand the barriers and facilitators to receiving a future COVID-19 vaccine so that we can provide recommendations for the design of interventions aimed at maximizing public acceptance. DESIGN: Cross-sectional UK survey with older adults and patients with chronic respiratory disease. METHODS: During the UK&#039;s early April 2020 &#039;lockdown&#039; period, 527 participants (311 older adults, mean age?=?70.4?years; 216 chronic respiratory participants, mean age?=?43.8?years) completed an online questionnaire assessing willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, perceptions of COVID-19, and intention to receive influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. A free text response (n?=?502) examined barriers and facilitators to uptake. The Behaviour Change Wheel informed the analysis of these responses, which were coded to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Behaviour change techniques (BCTs) were identified. RESULTS: Eighty-six per cent of respondents want to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. This was positively correlated with the perception that COVID-19 will persist over time, and negatively associated with perceiving the media to have over-exaggerated the risk. The majority of barriers and facilitators were mapped onto the &#039;beliefs about consequences&#039; TDF domain, with themes relating to personal health, health consequences to others, concerns of vaccine safety, and severity of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccination is currently high among high-risk individuals. Mass media interventions aimed at maximizing vaccine uptake should utilize the BCTs of information about health, emotional, social and environmental consequences, and salience of consequences.","Williams, Lynn; Gallant, Allyson J; Rasmussen, Susan; Brown Nicholls, Louise A; Cogan, Nicola; Deakin, Karen; Young, David; Flowers, Paul",,MEDLINE,"Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Vaccination; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Coronavirus Infections/prevention &amp;amp; control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Viral Vaccines",20200907.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12468,covidwho-744705,2044-8287,4,Br J Health Psychol,en,GB,2020.0,"Br J Health Psychol;25(4): 1039-1054, 2020 11.

"OBJECTIVE: To determine the additional diagnostic performance of a rapid serological test for detection of IgM and IgG antibodies compared to the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test; for detection of SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out including patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in 3 hospitals, health workers exposed to the infection and outpatients who met suspicious case criteria, all of which underwent the molecular test (RT-PCR) and the rapid serological test. The additional diagnostic performance of rapid serological test was evaluated in comparison to molecular tests. Likewise, an approximation was made to the sensitivity and specificity of the rapid serological test. RESULTS: 144 people were included. With the rapid test, 19.4% of positive results were obtained compared to 11.1% in the molecular test (p = 0.03). The rapid serological test detected 21 cases that had been negative by the initial (RT-PCR), providing an additional diagnostic performance of 56.8% compared to the RT-PCR. The additional diagnostic performance was 50.0% during the first week, 70.0% during the second week and 50.0% during the third week of symptom onset. The sensitivity of the rapid serological test was 43.8% and the specificity of 98.9%. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid serological test was able to detect a greater number of cases than those detected by the molecular test especially after the second week of onset of symptoms. It also showed high specificity. It is therefore useful as a complementary test to RT-PCR, especially during the second and third week of illness.","Vidal-Anzardo, Margot; Solis, Gilmer; Solari, Lely; Minaya, Gabriela; Ayala-Quintanilla, Beatriz; Astete-Cornejo, Jonh; Luque-Aguilar, Amparo; Jorge, Ana; Rojas, Nancy; Cardenas, Fanny; Soto, Alonso",,MEDLINE,"Betacoronavirus/isolation &amp;amp; purification; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections/diagnosis; Immunoglobulin G/blood; Immunoglobulin M/blood; Pneumonia, Viral/diagnosis; Adult; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; COVID-19 Vaccines; Coronavirus Infections/immunology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral/immunology; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods; SARS-CoV-2; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serologic Tests/methods",20200903.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.17843/rpmesp.2020.372.5534,covidwho-740620,1726-4642,2,Rev Peru Med Exp Salud Publica,es,PE,2020.0,"Rev Peru Med Exp Salud Publica;37(2): 203-209, 2020.

"BACKGROUND: Faced with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the development of COVID-19 vaccines has been progressing at an unprecedented rate. This study aimed to evaluate the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination in China and give suggestions for vaccination strategies and immunization programs accordingly. METHODS: In March 2020, an anonymous cross-sectional survey was conducted online among Chinese adults. The questionnaire collected socio-demographic characteristics, risk perception, the impact of COVID-19, attitudes, acceptance and attribute preferences of vaccines against COVID-19 during the pandemic. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the influencing factors of vaccination acceptance. RESULTS: Of the 2058 participants surveyed, 1879 (91.3%) stated that they would accept COVID-19 vaccination after the vaccine becomes available, among whom 980 (52.2%) wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible, while others (47.8%) would delay the vaccination until the vaccine&#039;s safety was confirmed. Participants preferred a routine immunization schedule (49.4%) to emergency vaccination (9.0%) or either of them (41.6%). Logistic regression showed that being male, being married, perceiving a high risk of infection, being vaccinated against influenza in the past season, believing in the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination or valuing doctor&#039;s recommendations could increase the probability of accepting COVID-19 vaccination as soon as possible, while having confirmed or suspected cases in local areas, valuing vaccination convenience or vaccine price in decision-making could hinder participants from immediate vaccination. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic period, a strong demand for and high acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination has been shown among the Chinese population, while concerns about vaccine safety may hinder the promotion of vaccine uptake. To expand vaccination coverage, immunization programs should be designed to remove barriers in terms of vaccine price and vaccination convenience, and health education and communication from authoritative sources are important ways to alleviate public concerns about vaccine safety.","Wang, Jiahao; Jing, Rize; Lai, Xiaozhen; Zhang, Haijun; Lyu, Yun; Knoll, Maria Deloria; Fang, Hai",,MEDLINE,,20200902.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8030482,covidwho-739120,2076-393X,3,,en,CH,2020.0,Vaccines (Basel);8(3)2020 Aug 27. ,Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccination during the COVID-19 Pandemic in China.,article,,,8
"The COVID-19 disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a rapidly emerging pandemic which has enforced extreme containment measures worldwide. In the absence of a vaccine or efficient treatment, cost-effective epidemiological surveillance strategies are urgently needed. Here, we have used RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection in a series of longitudinal metropolitan wastewaters samples collected from February to April 2020, during the earliest stages of the epidemic in the Region of Valencia, Spain. We were able to consistently detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples taken in late February, when communicated cases in that region were only incipient. We also find that the wastewater viral RNA context increased rapidly and anticipated the subsequent ascent in the number of declared cases. Our results strongly suggest that the virus was undergoing community transmission earlier than previously believed, and suggest that wastewater analysis could be sensitive and cost-effective strategy for COVID-19 epidemiological surveillance. Routine implementation of this surveillance tool would significantly improve our preparedness against new or re-occurring viral outbreaks.","Randazzo, Walter; Cuevas-Ferrando, Enric; Sanju¨¢n, Rafael; Domingo-Calap, Pilar; S¨¢nchez, Gloria",,MEDLINE,,20200902.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113621,covidwho-738775,1618-131X,,Int J Hyg Environ Health,en,DE,2020.0,"Int J Hyg Environ Health;230: 113621, 2020 Sep 01.

"The present study aims to evaluate whether influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations are associated with positive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) testing to detect SARS-CoV-2. Data from the Italian cross-sectional web-based survey (EPICOVID19), based on a self-selection sample of individuals aged &amp;#8805;18, were considered. The probability of a positive SARS-CoV-2 NPS test result as a function of influenza or anti-pneumococcal vaccination was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression, stratifying analysis by age (&lt;65 years, &amp;#8805;65 years). From April 2020, 170,731 individuals aged &lt;65 years and 28,097 &amp;#8805;65 years filled out the EPICOVID19 questionnaire.

"BACKGROUND: The impact of countries&#039; bacillus Calmette-Gu¨¦rin (BCG) vaccination policies on the course of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is a curiosity. In this study, the relationship between BCG vaccination status and severity of COVID-19 pneumonia and the factors affecting disease severity were investigated. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted between March and June 2020 in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia, confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 polymerase chain reaction positivity in a nasopharyngeal sample and pulmonary infiltrates in computed chest tomography, in a state hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. Socio-demographic features, body mass index, smoking status, concomitant diseases, income rates and BCG vaccination status of subjects were analyzed. RESULT: The study population comprised 123 adults with COVID-19 pneumonia [mean age?=?49¡¤7 years, standard deviation?=?13¡¤3 years; 82 (66¡¤7%) male]. While the rate of cases vaccinated with BCG is lower (68¡¤5 versus 88¡¤2%, P?=?0¡¤026), mean age (54¡¤0?¡À?11¡¤5 years versus 38¡¤3?¡À?10¡¤7 years; P?&lt;?0¡¤001), diabetes (32¡¤6 versus 5¡¤9%, P?=?0¡¤002) and low income (84¡¤3 versus 52¡¤9%, P?&lt;?0¡¤001) are higher in patients with severe disease compared to those with mild disease. According to multivariate analysis increasing age [odds ratio (OR)?=?1¡¤119; 95% confidence interval (CI)?= 1¡¤062-1¡¤178, P?&lt;?0¡¤001] and low income (OR?=?3¡¤209; 95% CI?=?1¡¤008-10¡¤222, P?=?0¡¤049) are associated with severe disease in COVID-19 pneumonia.

"Importance: As schools consider reopening for in-person instruction prior to availability of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine, families may be weighing their priorities regarding school attendance. Objective: To characterize the association of planned in-person school attendance during the COVID-19 pandemic with factors, including family socioeconomic characteristics, and parent attitudes and beliefs about their child&#039;s school attendance. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional survey study. Data were collected from June 2, 2020, to June 5, 2020, weighted to reflect population norms, and analyzed using ordered probit regression. A sample of US parents (of children ages 5-17 years) were recruited using a nonprobability survey panel with stratification by socioeconomic characteristics. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was parent-reported plan to send their child to school or keep their child home, conditional on their school opening for in-person instruction. Additional measures assessed family socioeconomic characteristics, medical vulnerability, worry about COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome, confidence in their child&#039;s school, and homeschooling difficulties. Results: The sample of 730 parents was balanced by parent sex (53% women) with successful oversampling for Black (28%; n = 201) and Hispanic (27%; n = 200) participants. In estimates weighted to US population norms, 31% (95% CI, 27% to 34%) of participants indicated they would probably or definitely keep their child home this fall, and 49% indicated that they would probably or definitely send their child to school this fall. Factors associated with planning to keep children home included lower income (38% with incomes &lt;$50a?¡¥000 vs 21% with incomes $100a?¡¥000-$150a?¡¥000 per year; difference, 17%; 95% CI, 9% to 26%), being unemployed (40% unemployed vs 26% employed; difference, 14%; 95% CI, 5% to 25%), and having a flexible job (33% with flexible jobs vs 19% with inflexible jobs; difference, 14%; 95% CI, 5% to 30%). Planning to keep children home was also associated with fear of COVID-19 (B = 0.19; P &lt; .001), fear of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (B = 0.12; P = .04), confidence in schools (B = -0.22; P &lt; .001), and challenges of homeschooling (B = -0.12; P = .01). Race and ethnicity were not significantly associated with plans to keep children home. Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study, many parents planned to keep children home in fall 2020. Schools need to act soon to address parental concerns and provide options for what will be available for them should they opt to keep their child home. Structural barriers, such as lack of workplace flexibility and potential school-level inequities in implementation of preventive measures, must be acknowledged and addressed where possible.","Kroshus, Emily; Hawrilenko, Matt; Tandon, Pooja S; Christakis, Dimitri A",,MEDLINE,,20200817.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2020.3864,covidwho-713659,2168-6211,,JAMA pediatr.

"Background: An infection (COVID-19) without any specific cure makes the people more vulnerable to get affected due to insufficient knowledge and unhealthy practices. In this scenario, healthcare students can act as reliable information providers. This study aimed to assess the knowledge and perception about COVID-19 among medical and allied health science students. Methods: A web-based cross sectional survey was conducted during February and March 2020. A 24-item survey was developed and randomly distributed among the study population. Descriptive statistics was applied to represent participant characteristics and Chi-square test was used to evaluate the level of association among variables with a significance level of p &lt; 0.01. Results: Total, 97.95% (715/730) participants completed the survey. High proportion of students were from pharmacy (45.73%) followed by medical (22.52%), physiotherapy, nursing and dental background. Majority of participants were having adequate knowledge while about 18% had partial knowledge about the symptoms of severe COVID-19 cases. Students have shown a positive perception of COVID-19 prevention and control while few invalid responses related to the use of herbal medicines or garlic were noted. About 50% had rightly stated that, the antibiotics and vaccine are not effective in COVID-19 infection at present. Conclusion: As the COVID-19 cases are rapidly increasing worldwide, it is essential to improve the knowledge and beliefs among general public to prevent its spread.

"The debate around vaccines has been in the spotlight over the last few years in Europe, both within the scientific community and the general public debate. In this regard, the case of the Italian vaccination debate is particularly worrying given that Italy has been one of the European countries with the highest number of measles cases in the recent past. According to this scenario, we conducted a cross-sectional study on a convenience sample of Italian university students aimed at: (1) exploring their attitudes towards a future vaccine to prevent COVID-19 and; (2) evaluating the impact of the university curricula (healthcare vs. non-healthcare curricula) on the intention to vaccinate. Descriptive analysis on the 735 students that answered to the question on the intention to vaccinate showed that 633 (86.1%) students reported that they would choose to have a vaccination for the COVID-19 coronavirus; on the other side, 102 (13.9%) students reported that they would not or be not sure to vaccine (low intention to vaccinate). This means that in our sample more than one student out of 10 shows low intention to vaccinate (vaccine hesitancy). Furthermore, when running analysis comparing healthcare students versus non-healthcare students we found no significant differences in responses&#039; percentage distribution (p = .097). Understanding the student&#039;s perspective about the future COVID-19 vaccine and supporting their health engagement and consciousness may be useful in planning adequate response and multidisciplinary educational strategies-including the psychological perspective on vaccine hesitancy underlying factors - in the post-pandemic period.","Barello, Serena; Nania, Tiziana; Dellafiore, Federica; Graffigna, Guendalina; Caruso, Rosario",,MEDLINE,"Coronavirus Infections/prevention &amp;amp; control; Pandemics/prevention &amp;amp; control; Pneumonia, Viral/prevention &amp;amp; control; Students/psychology; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Europe; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Intention; Italy/epidemiology; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; SARS-CoV-2; Students/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Universities; Vaccination/psychology; Viral Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; Viral Vaccines/adverse effects",20200810.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10654-020-00670-z,covidwho-695266,1573-7284,8,Eur J Epidemiol,en,NL,2020.0,"Eur J Epidemiol;35(8): 781-783, 2020 Aug.

"Introduction: Several vaccine candidates are being clinically tested in response to the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. This study was conducted to assess the acceptance of a 50 or 95% effective COVID-19 vaccine, when it becomes available in southeast Asia, among the general population in Indonesia. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between March 25 and April 6, 2020. Participants were asked if they would accept a free vaccine which was 95 or 50% effective. Using a logistic regression model, we assessed the associations between sociodemographic characteristics, exposure to COVID-19 information, or perceived risk of infection with acceptance of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. Results: Among 1,359 respondents, 93.3% of respondents (1,268/1,359) would like to be vaccinated for a 95% effective vaccine, but this acceptance decreased to 67.0% (911/1,359) for a vaccine with 50% effectiveness. For a 95% effective vaccine, being a healthcare worker and having a higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection were associated with higher acceptance, adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.01; 95%CI: 1.01, 4.00 and aOR: 2.21; 95%CI: 1.07, 4.59, respectively; compared to civil servants, being retired was associated with less acceptance (aOR: 0.15; 95%CI: 0.04, 0.63). For a 50% effective vaccine, being a healthcare worker was also associated with greater acceptance, aOR: 1.57; 95%CI: 1.12, 2.20. Conclusion: Acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine was highly influenced by the baseline effectiveness of the vaccine. Preparing the general population to accept a vaccine with relatively low effectiveness may be difficult.","Harapan, Harapan; Wagner, Abram L; Yufika, Amanda; Winardi, Wira; Anwar, Samsul; Gan, Alex Kurniawan; Setiawan, Abdul Malik; Rajamoorthy, Yogambigai; Sofyan, Hizir; Mudatsir, Mudatsir",,MEDLINE,COVID-19 Vaccines; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Adult; COVID-19/epidemiology; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; COVID-19 Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Indonesia/epidemiology; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult,20200810.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00381,covidwho-695784,2296-2565,,Front Public Health,en,CH,2020.0,"Front Public Health;8: 381, 2020.

"OBJECTIVES: We estimate the point seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the frontline firefighter/paramedic workforce of a South Florida fire department located in the epicentre of a State outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used to estimate the point seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a rapid immunoglobulin (Ig)M-IgG combined point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay among frontline firefighters/paramedics collected over a 2-day period, 16-17 April 2020. Fire department personnel were emailed a survey link assessing COVID-19 symptoms and work exposures the day prior to the scheduled drive-through antibody testing at a designated fire station. Off-duty and on-duty firefighter/paramedic personnel drove through the fire station/training facility in their personal vehicles or on-duty engine/rescue trucks for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. RESULTS: Among the 203 firefighters/paramedics that make up the fire department workforce, 18 firefighters/paramedics (8.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, of which 8 firefighters/paramedics (3.9%) were IgG positive only, 8 (3.9%) were IgM positive only and 2 (0.1%) were IgG/IgM positive. The positive predictive value (PPV) of the serological test is estimated to be 33.2% and the negative predictive value is 99.3%. The average number of COVID-19 case contacts (ie, within 6 feet of an infected person (laboratory-confirmed or probable COVID-19 patient) for &amp;#8805;15 min) experienced by firefighters/paramedics was higher for those with positive serology compared with those with negative (13.3 cases vs 7.31 cases; p=0.022). None of the antibody positive firefighters/paramedics reported receipt of the annual influenza vaccine compared with firefighters/paramedics who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (0.0% vs 21.0%; p=0.027). CONCLUSION: Rapid SARS-CoV-2 IgM-IgG antibody testing documented early-stage and late-stage infection in a firefighter workforce providing insight to a broader medical surveillance project on return to work for firefighters/paramedics. Given the relatively low PPV of the serological test used in this study back in April 2020, caution should be used in interpreting test results.","Caban-Martinez, Alberto J; Schaefer-Solle, Natasha; Santiago, Katerina; Louzado-Feliciano, Paola; Brotons, Angel; Gonzalez, Marco; Issenberg, S Barry; Kobetz, Erin",,MEDLINE,"Allied Health Personnel; Betacoronavirus/immunology; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Firefighters; Immunoglobulin G/blood; Immunoglobulin M/blood; Occupational Exposure; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Adult; Antibodies, Viral/blood; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; Clinical Laboratory Techniques/methods; Coronavirus Infections/blood; Coronavirus Infections/diagnosis; Coronavirus Infections/virology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Florida/epidemiology; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral/blood; Pneumonia, Viral/diagnosis; Pneumonia, Viral/virology; Population Surveillance; Prevalence; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Workplace; Young Adult",20200810.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2020-106676,covidwho-695387,1470-7926,12,Occup Environ Med,en,GB,2020.0,"Occup Environ Med;77(12): 857-861, 2020 12.

"During this unprecedented novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, there is an urgent need for empirical data to characterise its impact on the mental health and well-being of Australians. In this viewpoint, we outline a number of considerations for research on this topic, highlighting areas necessitating special attention, consideration of particular vulnerable groups and the need for longitudinal studies to track mental health fluctuations in the general population. We conclude by introducing the COLLATE (COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy) project, outlining its aims, addressing some considerations raised herein and detailing avenues for future research. Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 (WHO, 2020), the COVID-19 pandemic has caused major upheaval both in Australia and globally. While the search for a vaccine continues, current efforts towards tackling the virus and limiting contagion in several nations have focused on social distancing and the shutdown of non-essential services. In Australia, the first case was reported on 13 January 2020 (COVID-19 National Incident Room Surveillance Team, 2020), the first death occurred on 24 February and a spate of progressive restrictions were enforced throughout the 2 weeks leading up to 31 March 2020 (COVID-19 National Incident Room Surveillance Team, 2020a).","Tan, Eric J; Meyer, Denny; Neill, Erica; Phillipou, Andrea; Toh, Wei Lin; Van Rheenen, Tamsyn E; Rossell, Susan L",,MEDLINE,"Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Mental Health; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Public Health; Australia; COVID-19; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Mental Health Services; Pandemics",20200806.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0004867420947815,covidwho-694714,1440-1614,11,Aust N Z J Psychiatry,en,GB,2020.0,"Aust N Z J Psychiatry;54(11): 1067-1071, 2020 11.

"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral agents for therapy. Little is known about the longitudinal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Blood samples (n=173) were collected from 30 COVID-19 patients over a 3-month period after symptom onset and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs, using the lentiviral pseudotype assay, coincident with the levels of IgG and proinflammatory cytokines. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2-specific NAb titers were low for the first 7-10 d after symptom onset and increased after 2-3 weeks. The median peak time for NAbs was 33 d (IQR 24-59 d) after symptom onset. NAb titers in 93¡¤3% (28/30) of the patients declined gradually over the 3-month study period, with a median decrease of 34¡¤8% (IQR 19¡¤6-42¡¤4%). NAb titers increased over time in parallel with the rise in IgG antibody levels, correlating well at week 3 (r = 0¡¤41, p &amp; 0¡¤05). The NAb titers also demonstrated a significant positive correlation with levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including SCF, TRAIL, and M-CSF. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide useful information regarding dynamic changes in NAbs in COVID-19 patients during the acute and convalescent phases.","Wang, Kai; Long, Quan-Xin; Deng, Hai-Jun; Hu, Jie; Gao, Qing-Zhu; Zhang, Gui-Ji; He, Chang-Long; Huang, Lu-Yi; Hu, Jie-Li; Chen, Juan; Tang, Ni; Huang, Ai-Long",,MEDLINE,,20200805.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1143,covidwho-693303,1537-6591,,Clin. infect. dis,en,US,2020.0,Clin Infect Dis;2020 Aug 03. ,Longitudinal dynamics of the neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.,article,,,
"BACKGROUND: The development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection is on the way. To prepare for public availability, the acceptability of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine and willingness to pay (WTP) were assessed to provide insights into future demand forecasts and pricing considerations. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 3 to 12 April 2020. The health belief model (HBM) was used to assess predictors of the intent to receive the vaccine and the WTP. RESULTS: A total of 1,159 complete responses was received. The majority reported a definite intent to receive the vaccine (48.2%), followed by a probable intent (29.8%) and a possible intent (16.3%). Both items under the perceived benefits construct in the HBM, namely believe the vaccination decreases the chance of infection (OR?=?2.51, 95% CI 1.19-5.26) and the vaccination makes them feel less worry (OR?=?2.19, 95% CI 1.03-4.65), were found to have the highest significant odds of a definite intention to take the vaccine. The mean ¡À standard deviation (SD) for the amount that participants were willing to pay for a dose of COVID-19 vaccine was MYR$134.0 (SD¡À79.2) [US$30.66 ¡À 18.12]. Most of the participants were willing to pay an amount of MYR$100 [US$23] (28.9%) and MYR$50 [US$11.5] (27.2%) for the vaccine. The higher marginal WTP for the vaccine was influenced by no affordability barriers as well as by socio-economic factors, such as higher education levels, professional and managerial occupations and higher incomes. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate the utility of HBM constructs in understanding COVID-19 vaccination intention and WTP.","Wong, Li Ping; Alias, Haridah; Wong, Pooi-Fong; Lee, Hai Yen; AbuBakar, Sazaly",,MEDLINE,"Betacoronavirus/immunology; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Vaccination/psychology; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Coronavirus Infections/economics; Coronavirus Infections/prevention &amp;amp; control; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Care Surveys; Health Expenditures; Humans; Malaysia/epidemiology; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Psychological; Pandemics/prevention &amp;amp; control; Pneumonia, Viral/prevention &amp;amp; control; SARS-CoV-2; Socioeconomic Factors; Vaccination/economics; Viral Vaccines/economics; Young Adult",20200803.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1790279,covidwho-691276,2164-554X,9,Hum Vaccin Immunother,en,US,2020.0,"Hum Vaccin Immunother;16(9): 2204-2214, 2020 09 01.

"Background: In the absence of an effective vaccine, public health policies are aimed at awareness, and education of the general public in order to contain the quickly spreading COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the recommended precautionary measures are dependent on human behaviors and therefore their effectiveness largely depends on peoples&#039; perception and attitudes toward the disease. This study aimed to assess the level of knowledge, risk perception, and precautionary measures taken in response to COVID-19 in North America. Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, an online survey targeted to North Americans focused on the public&#039;s knowledge of COVID-19, risk perception, and precautionary behaviors taken in response to this pandemic. Descriptive analyses were performed for the whole population and the subgroup analyses contrasted the differences between Americans and Canadians. Results: The cohort comprised 1,264 relatively young participants with an average age of 28.6 ¡À 9.8 years. The vast majority (&gt;90%) were knowledgeable about COVID-19. Regarding risk perception, about a quarter assumed to be at less risk to contract the disease, and 42.8% considered themselves to be less contagious than others. While the vast majority avoided performing risky behaviors, only a small proportion (13.2%) wore a face mask-which is in line with the public health recommendations of the two countries at the time of data collection. Overall, a larger proportion of Canadian participants (55.8%) were satisfied with the performance of their national public health in response to the current pandemic, compared to their American counterparts (12.2%). Discussion: Data regarding the public&#039;s knowledge of COVID-19, risk perception, and behaviors in response to this pandemic is limited. The results of this study highlight that this relatively young and educated sample of North Americans had a high level of knowledge about COVID-19 and a large proportion of them were taking the precautionary measures against this pandemic. However, a significant number of individuals believe to be at less risk of contracting the disease compared to the general population. Educating the public that no one is safe from this disease, could play a role in further limiting risky behaviors and ultimately facilitating disease containment.","Salimi, Ali; ElHawary, Hassan; Diab, Nermin; Smith, Lee",,MEDLINE,"COVID-19/epidemiology; COVID-19/prevention &amp;amp; control; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Pandemics; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Canada/epidemiology; Communicable Disease Control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Policy; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Assessment; United States/epidemiology; Young Adult",20200731.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00358,covidwho-689051,2296-2565,,Front Public Health,en,CH,2020.0,"Front Public Health;8: 358, 2020.

"Importance: In the absence of a vaccine and therapeutic agent, personal hygiene and physical distancing are essential measures to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Objective: To determine whether a social media campaign, targeted at the gaps in behavior on personal hygiene and physical distancing and distributed nationwide via digital news media, may be an effective method to improve behavior and help to inhibit person-to-person transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study was designed to uncover self-reported gaps in behavior regarding personal hygiene and physical distancing in the Netherlands. A diagnostic survey was distributed by a large national newspaper (De Telegraaf) and a popular social influencer (Govert Sweep) on March 17, 2020, and was completed by 16a?¡¥072 participants. Analysis of these outcomes showed that coughing and sneezing in the elbow was done well, but that handwashing, face touching, and physical distancing showed serious gaps compared with advised behavior. This diagnostic information was used to design infographics and a video targeted at repairing these gaps in behavior. The video and infographics were distributed on a national level on March 21, 2020, followed by a postcampaign survey to measure the results on March 24, 2020. Data analysis was performed from March to April 2020. Exposure: Exposed participants were those who viewed the infographics and/or video. Main Outcomes and Measures: Improvement on the extent of handwashing in all areas, handwashing duration of 20 seconds or longer, awareness on face touching, and physical distancing were measured according to responses on the postcampaign survey. Results: A total of 17a?¡¥189 participants (mean [SD] age, 47.61 [13.57] years; 9100 women [52.9%]) responded to the postcampaign survey. The news article in De Telegraaf was read more than 2 million times, and the influencer video was watched more than 80a?¡¥000 times. Cross-sectional analysis of the postcampaign survey using logistic regression correcting for age, gender, and educational level showed that exposure to the video plus infographics (827 participants) (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.14; 95% CI, 1.83-2.50; P &lt; .001) and to the infographics alone (11a?¡¥348 participants) (adjusted OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.22-1.40; P &lt; .001) were positively associated with washing hands in all areas compared with the unexposed group (4751 participants). In addition, exposure to the video plus infographics (adjusted OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.59-2.16; P &lt; .001) and to the infographics alone (adjusted OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.19-1.36; P &lt; .001) were positively associated with washing hands long enough compared with the unexposed group. Exposure to the video alone was not associated with improved handwashing. Compared with the unexposed group, exposure to the infographics alone and video plus infographics were associated with improvements in physical distancing when the participant had COVID-19 syptoms (infographics alone, adjusted OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17; P = .006; video plus infographics, adjusted OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69-0.91; P = .001) and face touching (infographics alone, adjusted OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.22-1.38; P &lt; .001; infographics and video, adjusted OR, 1.49, 95% CI, 1.30-1.71; P &lt; .001). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that a targeted behavioral change campaign, promoted by a news platform and social media, was associated with self-reported improvement in personal hygiene with the aim to prevent person-to-person transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. This method of evidence-based campaigning may be an effective way to improve critical public health issues, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Yousuf, Hamza; Corbin, Jonathan; Sweep, Govert; Hofstra, Martijn; Scherder, Erik; van Gorp, Eric; Zwetsloot, Peter Paul; Zhao, Jiayu; van Rossum, Bert; Jiang, Ting; Lindemans, Jan-Willem; Narula, Jagat; Hofstra, Leonard",,MEDLINE,"Coronavirus Infections/prevention &amp;amp; control; Hand Disinfection; Health Behavior; Health Promotion; Mass Media; Pandemics/prevention &amp;amp; control; Pneumonia, Viral/prevention &amp;amp; control; Public Health; Social Media; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Netherlands; Odds Ratio; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",20200709.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.14323,covidwho-635849,2574-3805,7,JAMA Netw Open,en,US,2020.0,"JAMA Netw Open;3(7): e2014323, 2020 07 01.

"This research asks how an epidemic affects human behaviour. Probably the COVID-19 contagion is the most adverse global public health, economic, social, and technological stress since the Second World War. It affects almost all countries and challenges the globalisation particularly the global supply chain. The research community struggles with the multidimensional consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. The critical goal is to quickly implement an efficient vaccine, as the society faces a tradeoff between death exposure and the size of the economic downturn. With this paper, we search for factors affecting contagion, mortality, and the time span between the country virus inception and first death. Additionally, we analyse the development of social media and financial markets. We applied a panel data set on all of the countries across the globe from 31 December 2019 until 31 March 2020 to investigate the patterns of epidemic development. We examined 7,642 country-daily data. We constructed classification tree regression, panel, and cross-sectional regression models. Our results support the conclusion that: 1) the speed of severity and contagion is different between themselves and across continents, 2) financial markets and social media respond differently to factors affecting contagion and severity, and 3) the time span between the first contagion in the economy and first death case cannot be plausibly explained with time-invariant variables. This research supports the policymakers with robust data for the informative allocation of scarce resources.","Staszkiewicz, Piotr; Chomiak-Orsa, Iwona; Staszkiewicz, Igor",,ELSEVIER,,20200708.0,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2999614,covidwho-634832,21693536,8,IEEE Access,en,,2020.0,"IEEE Access;(8): 106009-106022, 2020.","Dynamics of the COVID-19 Contagion and Mortality: Country Factors, Social Media, and Market Response Evidence from a Global Panel Analysis",article,,,
"Purpose: The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the worst global crisis after the Second World War. Since no successful treatment and vaccine have been reported, efforts to enhance the knowledge, attitudes, and practice of the public, especially the high-risk groups, are critical to manage COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this study aimed to assess knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19 among patients with chronic disease. Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 404 chronic disease patients from March 02 to April 10, 2020, at Addis Zemen Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses with a 95% confidence interval were fitted to identify factors associated with poor knowledge and practice towards COVID-19. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was used to determine the magnitude of the association between the outcome and independent variables. P-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The mean age of the participants was 56.5¡À13.5. The prevalence of poor knowledge and poor practice was 33.9% and 47.3%, respectively. Forty-one percent of the participants perceived that avoiding of attending a crowded population is very difficult. Age (AOR=1.05, (95% CI (1.01-1.08)), educational status of &quot;can&#039;t read and write&quot; (AOR=7.1, 95% CI (1.58-31.93)), rural residence (AOR=19.0, 95% CI (6.87-52.66)) and monthly income (AOR=0.8, 95% CI (0.79-0.89)) were significantly associated with poor knowledge.

"OBJECTIVES: Determine major barriers to, and facilitators of, influenza vaccination of Aboriginal adults, in order to improve coverage from the current level of 30%. METHODS: i) A focus group with 13 Aboriginal Immunisation Healthcare Workers; and ii) a cross-sectional survey of Aboriginal people aged &amp;#8805;18 years at the 2017 New South Wales Koori Knockout (29 September-2 October). RESULTS: The focus group nominated poor identification of Aboriginality in general practice. Of 273 survey respondents, a substantial minority (30%) were unaware of their eligibility for free influenza vaccination. More than half (52%) believed the vaccine could cause influenza, 40% reported there were better ways than vaccination for avoiding infection and 30% said they would not have the vaccine if it was offered to them. Regarding health service access, few reported experiencing difficulty (17%), feeling uncomfortable (15%) or being discriminated against (8%), but 53% reported not receiving a reminder from a health professional. CONCLUSIONS: Misconceptions about influenza disease and vaccine among Aboriginal people and inadequate identification of Aboriginality in general practice appear to be the greatest barriers to vaccination, rather than health service access in general. Implications for public health: More active communication to and targeting of Aboriginal adults is required; this is even more urgent following the arrival of COVID-19.","Menzies, Robert; Aqel, Jalil; Abdi, Ikram; Joseph, Telphia; Seale, Holly; Nathan, Sally",,MEDLINE,"Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Services Accessibility; Influenza Vaccines/administration &amp;amp; dosage; Influenza, Human/prevention &amp;amp; control; Oceanic Ancestry Group/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Vaccination/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; General Practice; Health Personnel; Health Services, Indigenous/organization &amp;amp; administration; Humans; Immunization Programs; Male; Middle Aged; Oceanic Ancestry Group/psychology; Vaccination Coverage",20200629.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1753-6405.13004,covidwho-614813,1753-6405,4,Aust N Z J Public Health,en,AU,2020.0,"Aust N Z J Public Health;44(4): 279-283, 2020 Aug.

"The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an endemic virus in dromedaries. Annually, Saudi Arabia imports thousands of camels from the Horn of Africa, yet the epidemiology of MERS-CoV in these animals is largely unknown. Here, MERS-CoV prevalence was compared in imported African camels and their local counterparts. A total of 1399 paired sera and nasal swabs were collected from camels between 2016 and 2018. Imported animals from Sudan (n = 829) and Djibouti (n = 328) were sampled on incoming ships at Jeddah Islamic seaport before unloading, and local camels were sampled from Jeddah (n = 242). Samples were screened for neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and MERS-CoV viral RNA. The overall seroprevalence was 92.7% and RNA detection rate was 17.2%. Imported camels had higher seroprevalence compared to resident herds (93.8% vs 87.6%, p &lt;0.01) in contrast to RNA detection (13.3% vs 35.5%, p &lt;0.0001). Seroprevalence significantly increased with age (p&lt;0.0001) and viral RNA detection rate was ~2-folds higher in camels &lt;2-year-old compared to older animals. RNA detection was higher in males verses females (24.3% vs 12.6%, p&lt;0.0001) but seroprevalence was similar. Concurrent positivity for viral RNA and nAbs was found in &gt;87% of the RNA positive animals, increased with age and was sex-dependent. Importantly, reduced viral RNA load was positively correlated with nAb titers. Our data confirm the widespread of MERS-CoV in imported and domestic camels in Saudi Arabia and highlight the need for continuous active surveillance and better prevention measures. Further studies are also warranted to understand camels correlates of protection for proper vaccine development.","Tolah, Ahmed M; Al Masaudi, Saad B; El-Kafrawy, Sherif A; Mirza, Ahmed A; Harakeh, Steve M; Hassan, Ahmed M; Alsaadi, Mohammed A; Alzahrani, Abdulrahman A; Alsaaidi, Ghaleb A; Amor, Nabil M S; Alagaili, Abdulaziz N; Hashem, Anwar M; Azhar, Esam I",,MEDLINE,"Antibodies, Viral/blood; Camelus/virology; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus/isolation &amp;amp; purification; RNA, Viral/blood; Animals; Antibodies, Neutralizing/blood; Coronavirus Infections/virology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Reservoirs/virology; Djibouti/epidemiology; Female; Male; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus/genetics; Prevalence; Saudi Arabia/epidemiology; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Sudan/epidemiology",20200629.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232790,covidwho-616862,1932-6203,5,PLoS One,en,US,2020.0,"PLoS One;15(5): e0232790, 2020.

"BACKGROUND: Identifying immune correlates of COVID-19 disease severity is an urgent need for clinical management, vaccine evaluation, and drug development. Here, we present a temporal analysis of key immune mediators, cytokines, and chemokines in blood of hospitalized COVID-19 patients from serial sampling and follow-up over 4 weeks. METHODS: A total of 71 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Beijing You&#039;an Hospital in China with either mild (53 patients) or severe (18 patients) disease were enrolled with 18 healthy volunteers. We measured 34 immune mediators, cytokines, and chemokines in peripheral blood every 4-7 days over 1 month per patient using a bioplex multiplex immunoassay. RESULTS: We found that the chemokine RANTES (CCL5) was significantly elevated, from an early stage of the infection, in patients with mild but not severe disease. We also found that early production of inhibitory mediators including IL-10 and IL-1RA were significantly associated with disease severity, and a combination of CCL5, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), and IL-10 at week 1 may predict patient outcomes. The majority of cytokines that are known to be associated with the cytokine storm in virus infections such as IL-6 and IFN-?3 were only significantly elevated in the late stage of severe COVID-19 illness. TNF-&amp;#945; and GM-CSF showed no significant differences between severe and mild cases. CONCLUSION: Together, our data suggest that early intervention to increase expression of CCL5 may prevent patients from developing severe illness. Our data also suggest that measurement of levels of CCL5, as well as IL-1RA and IL-10 in blood individually and in combination, might be useful prognostic biomarkers to guide treatment strategies.","Zhao, Yan; Qin, Ling; Zhang, Ping; Li, Kang; Liang, Lianchun; Sun, Jianping; Xu, Bin; Dai, Yanchao; Li, Xuemei; Zhang, Chi; Peng, Yanchun; Feng, Yingmei; Li, Ang; Hu, Zhongjie; Xiang, Haiping; Ogg, Graham; Ho, Ling-Pei; McMichael, Andrew; Jin, Ronghua; Knight, Julian C; Dong, Tao; Zhang, Yonghong",,MEDLINE,"Chemokine CCL5/immunology; Coronavirus Infections/immunology; Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein/immunology; Interleukin-10/immunology; Pneumonia, Viral/immunology; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Case-Control Studies; Coronavirus Infections/physiopathology; Cytokine Release Syndrome/immunology; Female; Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/immunology; Hospitalization; Humans; Immunoassay; Interferon-gamma/immunology; Interleukin-6/immunology; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral/physiopathology; SARS-CoV-2; Severity of Illness Index; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology",20200608.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.139834,covidwho-541270,2379-3708,13,JCI insight,en,US,2020.0,JCI Insight;5(13)2020 07 09. ,Longitudinal COVID-19 profiling associates IL-1RA and IL-10 with disease severity and RANTES with mild disease.,article,,,5
"BACKGROUND: In the light of the global spread of the novel Coronavirus known as COVID-19 and in the absence of an approved treatment and vaccination, Lebanon has taken national measures, among which was home quarantine of the general public in an attempt to flatten the epidemic curve and avoid flooding the health care system. AIM: This study aimed at evaluating the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptomatology (PTSS) during the times of COVID-19 quarantine among Lebanese citizens. METHOD: This quantitative cross-sectional study recruited 950 civilians and is aimed at measuring the prevalence of PTSS among the Lebanese citizens at an interval of 2 weeks and 1 month of COVID-19 quarantine. RESULTS: The results have shown that quarantine in Lebanon has started to give rise to Post-traumatic Stress Disorder symptomatology during the second week which was worsened in the fourth week of COVID-19 quarantine. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 quarantine has influenced the psychology of Lebanese citizens and might have persistent effects after the end of this phase which is recommended to be explored.","Fawaz, Mirna; Samaha, Ali",,MEDLINE,"Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections/prevention &amp;amp; control; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Pandemics/prevention &amp;amp; control; Pneumonia, Viral/prevention &amp;amp; control; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Quarantine/psychology; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/psychology; Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Female; Humans; Lebanon/epidemiology; Male; Prevalence; SARS-CoV-2; Young Adult",20200604.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0020764020932207,covidwho-505773,1741-2854,7,Int J Soc Psychiatry,en,GB,2020.0,"Int J Soc Psychiatry;66(7): 666-674, 2020 11.

"Introduction: The COVID-19 is currently the most horrible issue around the world as there is no proven vaccine or medicine for this rapidly spreading disease. The only way left to this situation is to slow down or eradicate the spreading by adopting preventing measures. Objective: The purpose of the study is to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices toward COVID-19 among Bangladeshi internet users. Material and Methods: A total of 441 respondents voluntarily participated in a web-based cross-sectional survey. A structured questionnaire was created using Google Forms and the link was shared through authors¡¯ networks. Collected information was analyzed using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate techniques. Results: Respondent of age 30 and above are more optimistic (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] =1.96, 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.13 to 3.41; P=0.016) compared to respondent of age 18-29. For 1 unit change in the knowledge score the likelihood of staying home and wearing mask increases by 1.73 (95% CI, 1.43 to 2.09; P&amp;lt;0.01) and 1.54 (95% CI, 1.25 to 1.77; P&amp;lt;0.01) times respectively. From the linear regression analysis, we see that urban residence type (vs. rural, ¦Â=0.274; P=0.024) are significantly associated with higher knowledge scores. Additionally, a significant positive correlation exists between the COVID-19 knowledge score and the preventive practice score (r=0.291, P &amp;lt;0.01). Conclusion: Although knowledge and preventive practices among Bangladeshi internet users are encouraging, this study suggests updated knowledge be provided by healthcare authorities to enhance appropriate preventive practices throughout the COVID-19 outbreak.","Rahman, Abdur; Sathi, Nusrat Jahan",,ELSEVIER,,20200604.0,https://doi.org/10.29333/ejgm/8223,covidwho-506184,25163507,17,Electro.

"OBJECTIVES: The incidence of emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease is variable across the different parts of the world. Apart from travel patterns, other factors determining this difference may include host immune response. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of tuberculosis (TB) endemicity and Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) coverage on COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. METHODS: We reviewed available data regarding TB incidence, BCG coverage (as per the World Health Organization), and COVID-19 incidence of 174 countries. We divided the countries into four cohorts depending on annual TB incidence and BCG coverage. RESULTS: Countries with high TB incidence had lower COVID-19 than countries with low TB incidence. Similarly, countries with high BCG coverage had lower incidence of COVID-19, suggesting some protective mechanisms in TB-endemic areas. However, the ecological differences and different testing strategies between countries could not be accounted for in this analysis. CONCLUSION: Higher TB incidence and BCG coverage were found to be associated with lesser incidence of COVID-19. This outcome paves the way for further research into pathogenesis and immune response in COVID-19.","Madan, M; Pahuja, S; Mohan, A; Pandey, R M; Madan, K; Hadda, V; Tiwari, P; Guleria, R; Mittal, S",,MEDLINE,"BCG Vaccine/administration &amp;amp; dosage; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Global Health/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Tuberculosis/epidemiology; Vaccination Coverage/statistics &amp;amp; numerical data; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Incidence; Pandemics",20200601.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.05.042,covidwho-437215,1476-5616,,Public Health,en,NL,2020.0,"Public Health;185: 91-92, 2020 Aug.

"Fighting the current COVID-19 pandemic, we must not forget to prepare for the next. Since elderly and frail people are at high risk, we wish to predict their vulnerability, and intervene if possible. For example, it would take little effort to take additional swabs or dried blood spots. Such minimally-invasive sampling, exemplified here during screening for potential COVID-19 infection, can yield the data to discover biomarkers to better handle this and the next respiratory disease pandemic. Longitudinal outcome data can then be combined with other epidemics and old-age health data, to discover the best biomarkers to predict (i) coping with infection &amp; inflammation and thus hospitalization or intensive care, (ii) long-term health challenges, e.g. deterioration of lung function after intensive care, and (iii) treatment &amp; vaccination response. Further, there are universal triggers of old-age morbidity &amp; mortality, and the elimination of senescent cells improved health in pilot studies in idiopathic lung fibrosis &amp; osteoarthritis patients alike. Biomarker studies are needed to test the hypothesis that resilience of the elderly during a pandemic can be improved by countering chronic inflammation and/or removing senescent cells. Our review suggests that more samples should be taken and saved systematically, following minimum standards, and data be made available, to maximize healthspan &amp; minimize frailty, leading to savings in health care, gains in quality of life, and preparing us better for the next pandemic, all at the same time.","Fuellen, Georg; Liesenfeld, Oliver; Kowald, Axel; Barrantes, Israel; Bastian, Manuela; Simm, Andreas; Jansen, Ludger; Tietz-Latza, Alexander; Quandt, Dagmar; Franceschi, Claudio; Walter, Michael",,MEDLINE,"Aging/immunology; Biomarkers; Coronavirus Infections; Inflammation/diagnosis; Mass Screening/methods; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Aged; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Frailty; Humans; Quality of Life; SARS-CoV-2",20200525.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2020.101091,covidwho-343168,1872-9649,,Ageing Res Rev,en,GB,2020.0,"Ageing Res Rev;62: 101091, 2020 09.

"The attenuated avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), derived from a wild strain (TW2575/98w) in chicken embryos after 75 passages, is designed as a commercial vaccine strain (TW2575/98vac) to control the disease in Taiwan. The differences in viral infectivity, replication efficiency, and genome sequences between TW2575/98w and TW2575/98vac were determined and compared. TW2575/98vac caused earlier death of chicken embryos and had higher viral replication efficiency. Thirty amino acid substitutions resulting from 44 mutated nucleotides in the viral genome were found in TW2575/98vac. All of the molecular variations lead to attenuation, found in TW2575/98, were not observed consistently in the other IBVs (TW2296/95, Ark/Ark-DPI/81, the Massachusetts strain, GA98/CWL0470/98, and CK/CH/LDL/97I) and vice versa. After further comparisons and evaluations from three aspects: (1) longitudinal analysis on the timing of variations appeared in specific homologous strain passages, (2) horizontal evaluations with the amino acid changes between wild and vaccine strains among the other 5 IBVs, and (3) inspection on alterations in the chemical characteristics of substituted amino acid residues in viral proteins, four amino acid substitutions [V342D in p87, S1493P and P2025S in HD1, as well as F2308Y in HD1(P41)] were selected as highly possible candidates for successful TW2575/98w attenuation. Our findings imply that molecular variations, which contribute to the successful attenuation of different IBVs, are diverse and not restricted to a fixed pattern or specific amino acid substitutions in viral proteins. In addition, four amino acid changes within the replicase gene-encoded proteins might be associated with TW2575/98 virus virulence.","Tsai, Cheng-Ta; Wu, Hung-Yi; Wang, Ching-Ho",,MEDLINE,"Coronavirus Infections/virology; Genetic Variation; Genome, Viral; Genomics; Infectious bronchitis virus/genetics; 3&amp;apos; Untranslated Regions; Base Sequence; Genomics/methods; Virus Replication",20200514.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-020-01753-5,covidwho-245762,1572-994X,3,Virus Genes,en,US,2020.0,"Virus Genes;56(3): 369-379, 2020 Jun.

"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been recognized as a pandemic by the?World Health Organization. Global efforts have been exerted to prevent the spreading of the disease through political decisions together with personal behaviors, which depend on awareness of the public. The goal of this study is to assess the knowledge, perceptions and attitude of the Egyptian public towards the COVID-19 disease. We conducted a cross-sectional survey about these points, which was distributed among adult Egyptians. Five hundred and fifty nine persons completed the survey. The mean knowledge score was 16.39 out of 23, gained mainly though social media (66.9%), and the internet (58.3%). Knowledge was significantly lower among older, less educated, lower income participants, and rural residents. Most participants (86.9%) were concerned about the risk of infection. While 37.6% thought that their salary will be continued if they become isolated, 68.5% believed that it should be continued during this period. About 73.0% were looking forward to get the vaccine when available. In general, participants had a good knowledge about the disease and a positive attitude towards protective measures. This knowledge is gained mainly through novel media channels, which have pros and cons. Although the government has taken major steps to educate the public and limit the spread of the disease, more effort is needed to educate and support the lower economic strata. If a vaccine or a treatment is approved, we recommend a government control over its use to preserve the rights of the vulnerable and needy groups.","Abdelhafiz, Ahmed Samir; Mohammed, Zeinab; Ibrahim, Maha Emad; Ziady, Hany H; Alorabi, Mohamed; Ayyad, Mohamed; Sultan, Eman A",,MEDLINE,"Coronavirus Infections/prevention &amp;amp; control; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Pandemics/prevention &amp;amp; control; Pneumonia, Viral/prevention &amp;amp; control; Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Egypt/epidemiology; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Social Media; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",20200422.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10900-020-00827-7,covidwho-97441,1573-3610,5,J Community Health,en,NL,2020.0,"J Community Health;45(5): 881-890, 2020 10.

"Effective strategy to mitigate the ongoing pandemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) require a comprehensive understanding of humoral responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the emerging virus causing COVID-19. The dynamic profile of viral replication and shedding along with viral antigen specific antibody responses among COVID-19 patients started to be reported but there is no consensus on their patterns. Here, we conducted a serial investigation on 21 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in two medical centres from Jiangsu Province, including 11 non-severe COVID-19 patients, and 5 severe COVID-19 patients and 5 asymptomatic carriers based on nucleic acid test and clinical symptoms. The longitudinal swab samples and sera were collected from these people for viral RNA testing and antibody responses, respectively. Our data revealed different pattern of seroconversion among these groups. All 11 non-severe COVID-19 patients and 5 severe COVID-19 patients were seroconverted during hospitalization or follow-up period, suggesting that serological testing is a complementary assay to nucleic acid test for those symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Of note, immediate antibody responses were identified among severe cases, compared to non-severe cases. On the other hand, only one were seroconverted for asymptomatic carriers. The SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses were well-maintained during the observation period. Such information is of immediate relevance and would assist COVID-19 clinical diagnosis, prognosis and vaccine design.","Yongchen, Zhang; Shen, Han; Wang, Xinning; Shi, Xudong; Li, Yang; Yan, Jiawei; Chen, Yuxin; Gu, Bing",,MEDLINE,"Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections/diagnosis; Pneumonia, Viral/diagnosis; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus/genetics; Betacoronavirus/immunology; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; Child; Clinical Laboratory Techniques/methods; Coronavirus Infections/physiopathology; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral/physiopathology; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; Serologic Tests; Time Factors",20200421.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1756699,covidwho-88524,2222-1751,1,Emerg Microbes Infect,en,US,2020.0,"Emerg Microbes Infect;9(1): 833-836, 2020 Dec.

"A coronavirus pandemic has recently become one of the greatest threats the world is facing. Older adults are under a high risk of infection because of weaker immune systems. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to summarize the recent scientific evidence that outlines the effects of exercise on influenza or pneumonia in older adults. An electronic literature search was conducted using the WEB OF SCIENCE, SCIENCEDIRECT and GOOGLE SCHOLAR databases using the following keywords, &quot;Exercise,&quot; &quot;Older adult,&quot; &quot;Influenza,&quot; and &quot;Pneumonia.&quot; Any randomized control trials, cross-sectional and observational studies that related to this topic were all included. Twenty studies met the eligibility criteria for this review. Thirteen randomized control trials investigated the effects of exercise on the immune responses to influenza or pneumonia vaccination: seven trials employed moderate aerobic exercise, three employed resistance exercise, and the remaining three used Asian martial arts or special home-based exercises. Five cross-sectional and two observational studies examined the associations between exercise/physical condition and influenza/pneumonia. Most of the current studies suggested that prolonged moderate aerobic exercise may help to reduce the risk of influenza-related infection and improve the immune responses to influenza or pneumonia vaccination in older adults. In addition, training in traditional Asian martial arts was also found to be beneficial. Future research should focus on the different effects of moderate and vigorous exercise on influenza-related diseases.","Song, Yang; Ren, Feng; Sun, Dong; Wang, Meizi; Baker, Julien S; Istv¨¢n, B¨ªr¨®; Gu, Yaodong",,MEDLINE,"Betacoronavirus/immunology; Coronavirus Infections/immunology; Exercise Therapy; Influenza, Human/immunology; Pneumonia, Viral/immunology; Aged; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections/prevention &amp;amp; control; Coronavirus Infections/therapy; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Influenza, Human/prevention &amp;amp; control; Influenza, Human/therapy; Male; Observational Studies as Topic; Pandemics/prevention &amp;amp; control; Pneumonia, Viral/prevention &amp;amp; control; Pneumonia, Viral/therapy; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk Assessment; SARS-CoV-2",20200414.0,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17082655,covidwho-46233,1660-4601,8,Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),en,CH,2020.0,Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(8)2020 04 13. ,Benefits of Exercise on Influenza or Pneumonia in Older Adults: A Systematic Review.,article,,,17
